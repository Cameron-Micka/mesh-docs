# Choose your journey

## Try our Mesh 101 tutorial

If you're new to Mesh and like the idea of learning through a step-by-step tutorial, we recommend that you try our Mesh 101 tutorial. It starts you off with a pre-built Unity project and then walks you through the process of creating an educational windfarm experience. You'll learn how to use Mesh scripting and physics to add interactivity, and then you'll deploy the project as a metaverse Environment to your Mesh World.

If you're ready to starting building Mesh experiences, you have several approaches to choose from:

- Open and build upon an existing sample.

- Upgrade packages in a pre-existing Mesh project in Unity.

- Start a new project from scratch.

## Start with a Mesh sample

It's easiest to start with a sample file to ensure all packages are configured in your Unity project. We recommend this option if you haven't already created a Mesh project in Unity.

[Learn more about starting with a Mesh sample](samples-overview.md).

## Upgrade packages in a pre-existing Mesh project

You can upgrade the packages in your existing project and then continue developing.

1. Make sure your project uses the 3D (URP) project template.
1. [Download and unzip the Mesh toolkit](download-the-mesh-toolkit.md).
1. Import the Toolkit package into your project.

Note that you may encounter some configuration notifications with upgrading and replacing older packages.

## Start from scratch

If you'd like to start from scratch and build from the ground up, create a simple 3D URP (Core), then [download and unzip the Mesh toolkit](download-the-mesh-toolkit.md), and then import the Toolkit package into your project.

For a much more details explanation of how to set up a project for Mesh development, see the article named [Create a new Unity project](create-new-mesh-project.md).

## Add more features to your Environment

Once you've created an Environment through the paths mentioned above, you can add features including:

- [WebViews to display Web pages](../design-and-develop/enhance-your-environment/webcontent.md)

- [Cloud scripting](../design-and-develop/script-your-scene-logic/cloud-scripting-getting-started.md), [visual scripting](../design-and-develop/script-your-scene-logic/visual-scripting.md), and [Mesh Physics](../design-and-develop/enhance-your-environment/physics-interactions?branch=PuP-Mesh-Docs.md) to add interactivity

- And more!
