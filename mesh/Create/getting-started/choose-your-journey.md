# Choose your journey

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <License info TBD>
> To build experiences for Mesh, you must have intermediate to advanced Unity skills.

## Try our Mesh 101 tutorial

If you're new to Mesh and like the idea of learning through a step-by-step tutorial, we recommend that you try our [Mesh 101 tutorial](mesh-101-tutorial/mesh-101-01-overview-and-setup.md). It starts you off with a pre-built Unity project and then walks you through the process of creating an educational windfarm experience. You'll learn how to use Mesh scripting and physics to add interactivity, and then you'll deploy the project as a metaverse Environment to your Mesh World.

If you're ready to starting building Mesh experiences, you have several approaches to choose from:

- Open and build upon an existing sample.

- Update an existing project or create a new one.

## Start with a Mesh sample

It's easiest to start with a sample file to ensure all packages are configured in your Unity project. We recommend this option if you haven't already created a Mesh project in Unity.

[Learn more about starting with a Mesh sample](samples/samples-overview.md).

## Update an existing project or create a new one

You can make an existing Unity project Mesh-capable by [importing the Mesh Toolkit](../build-your-basic-environment/import-the-mesh-toolkit.md) or simply [create a new 3D URP (Core) project](../build-your-basic-environment/create-a-new-project-or-update.md) and then start building your Mesh experience from scratch. 

## Add more features to your Environment

Once you've created an Environment through the paths mentioned above, you can add features including:

- [WebViews to display Web pages](../enhance-your-environment/webcontent.md)

- [Cloud scripting](../script-your-scene-logic/cloud-scripting-getting-started.md), [visual scripting](../script-your-scene-logic/visual-scripting.md), and [Mesh Physics](../enhance-your-environment/physics-interactions.md) to add interactivity

- And more!
