# Mesh 101 Tutorial Chapter 6: Create an event and invite others

Now that you've uploaded your Mesh 101 Environment to the Azure portal, you can
create and produce an Event based on that Environment that participants
can experience through the Mesh app for PC or Quest.

See our document titled *Mesh Event Producer Guide* to create an Event
via the in-app event producer experience.

### Create an event

1. Open the Mesh app and then log in.

2. In the left-side vertical button bar, click the icon for your World,
    or click the ["All Worlds" button](#_Mesh_dashboard_overview) at the
    bottom left, and then select the world you want.

    **Notes**:
    - You may have to scroll to view all the worlds.
    - You can pin worlds to the left nav bar for easy access.

    select **Create event**.
