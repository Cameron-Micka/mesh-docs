# Mesh 101 Tutorial Chapter 1: Overview and Setup

The Mesh 101 tutorial is a great way to learn about adding Mesh features
to a Unity project to create an interactive learning experience. Created
for intermediate to advanced Unity developers, the tutorial will give
you a solid understanding of the power of Mesh, spanning Mesh Physics,
Scripting, and more. You'll start with a pre-built Unity project, add
custom interactivity and other Mesh features, and then deploy the
project as an *Environment* to Microsoft Mesh. Customers can
attend an Event based on your Environment where they'll learn about wind
turbines by visiting a series of interactive stations and experience
multi-user interaction and communication.

The tutorial project is named *Mesh101.Unity* and is included in the
Mesh Toolkit.

## Terminology

In Mesh terms, the project you create in Unity and then upload to the Mesh Portal or Azure Portal is called an *Environment*.

## Prerequisites

### Previous Unity experience

This tutorial assumes that you have the intermediate to advanced Unity skills needed to creative an Environment. If you don't, you can still [create, customize and produce](../../../Use/events-guide/create-event-mesh-portal.md) Mesh events using existing Environments.

### Hardware requirements

Minimum PC requirements: 4 CPU cores, 8Gb RAM

### Unity version 2022.3.7f1

Unity version 2022.3.7f1 is required for this tutorial.

[Get help installing Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallEditors.html)

Your installation should include modules for Android and Windows.

## Set things up for Mesh

### Download the Mesh desktop app

To download the app (codenamed **Project Napili**), you can visit the link below.
