# Prerequisites for Mesh Development

## License requirement

Developing with the Mesh Toolkit doesn't require a license; however, building and publishing your Environment to Mesh requires a Teams Premium license (hyperlink to /mesh/setup/content/setup-m365-mesh?branch=pr-en-us-256#licensing-requirements section)

## Unity version 2022.3.7f1+

You must use Unity version 2022.3.7f1+. Later versions will work, but you may see errors which can be bypassed.

Your installation should include modules for Android and Windows. When you create a new project, we recommend using the URP 3D Core template.

## Intermediate to advanced Unity skills

To build experiences for Mesh, you must have intermediate to advanced Unity skills.

*We can't guarantee that all steps will work as expected due to your unique Unity and computer configuration. There may be extra work needed on your end to triage errors or issues.*
