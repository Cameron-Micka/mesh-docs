# Microsoft Mesh Toolkit Sample: Toybox

![Toybox](../../../media/samples/005-toybox.png)

*Toybox* is a Mesh sample that empowers creators to build interactive Mesh experiences and games. The sample provides a number of activities that use mixtures of assets, shaders, visual scripting, animations, VFX, and SoundFX to drive social engagment across Mesh experiences:
  
* **Bean Bag Toss** 
* **Fire Pit & Roasting Marshmallows** 
* **Ice Breaker**
* **Sound Orbs** 
* **Radio & Boombox** 
* **Bonus: Astronaut**

The [Samples Overview](samples-overview.md) page contains instructions on how to download the Mesh Toolkit which contains this sample.
