# Samples Overview

The Mesh samples are a great way to learn about the different kinds of Mesh Experiences you can create and the features you add  to an Experience. They can also be used as a starting point for your custom Experience; each project is already set up with the packages you need and contains many assets that you might find useful.

## Mesh samples

- **Toybox**: A project that showcases a number of useful Mesh features: assets, shaders, visual scripting, animations, VFX, and SoundFX. [Learn more about the Toybox sample](toybox.md).

- **Physics Effects Gallery**: Contains a programmer-art designed scene that demonstrates the power of combining appealing visuals with the creative use of Mesh Physics features. [Learn more about the Physics Effects Gallery sample](physics-effects-gallery.md).

- **Dartroom**: A saloon-style room with a dart game to showcase interactive Mesh Physics features. [Learn more about the Dartroom sample](dartroom.md).

- **Science Building**: An expansive museum exhibiting the power of Mesh Physics to create dynamic, engaging experiences. [Learn more about the Science Building sample](science-building.md).

- **Mesh 101**: Mesh 101 is a tutorial, but it also doubles as a sample. In the project, you can open the *StartingPoint* scene and begin walking through the tutorial. However, the project contains another scene named *FinishedProject* which is a completed version of the tutorial. You can view this scene as a sample and use it as starting point for your project just as you would with any of the other samples. [Get started with the Mesh 101 tutorial](../mesh-101-tutorial/mesh-101-01-overview-and-setup.md).

**To start with a sample**:

1. If you haven't done so already, [download and unzip the Mesh toolkit](download-the-mesh-toolkit.md).

1. In the Unity Hub, select **Open** > **Add project from disk**, and then navigate to the **Mesh-Toolkit-Unity-main** folder that contains your samples.

1. Open the sample project you want. 

1. In Unity, navigate to **Assets** > **Scenes** and then open the scene you want---this will vary from sample to sample. For example, in the *Science Building* project, you would open the **ScienceBuilding** scene.

Here's an example of what you'll find in that scene:![](../../../media/get-started-developing-mesh/image007.png)
