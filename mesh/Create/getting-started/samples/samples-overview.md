# Samples Overview

The Mesh samples are a great way to learn about the different kinds of Mesh Experiences you can create and the features you add  to an Experience. They can also be used as a starting point for your custom Experience; each project is already set up with the packages you need and contains many assets that you might find useful.

## Mesh samples

- **Toybox**: A project that showcases a number of useful Mesh features: assets, shaders, visual scripting, animations, VFX, and SoundFX. [Learn more about the Toybox sample](toybox.md).

- **Physics Effects Gallery**: Contains a programmer-art designed scene that demonstrates the power of combining appealing visuals with the creative use of Mesh Physics features. [Learn more about the Physics Effects Gallery sample](physics-effects-gallery.md).

- **Dartroom**: A saloon-style room with a dart game to showcase interactive Mesh Physics features. [Learn more about the Dartroom sample](dartroom.md).

- **Science Building**: An expansive museum exhibiting the power of Mesh Physics to create dynamic, engaging experiences. [Learn more about the Science Building sample](science-building.md).

- **Mesh 101**: Mesh 101 is a tutorial, but it also doubles as a sample. In the project, you can open the *StartingPoint* scene and begin walking through the tutorial. However, the project contains another scene named *FinishedProject* which is a completed version of the tutorial. You can view this scene as a sample and use it as starting point for your project just as you would with any of the other samples. [Get started with the Mesh 101 tutorial](../mesh-101-tutorial/mesh-101-01-overview-and-setup.md).

**To start with a sample**:

1. If you haven't done so already, [download and unzip the Mesh toolkit](download-the-mesh-toolkit.md).

1. In the Unity Hub, select **Open** > **Add project from disk**, and then navigate to the **Mesh-Toolkit-Unity-main** folder that contains your samples.

1. Open the sample project you want. 

1. In Unity, navigate to **Assets** > **Scenes** and then open the scene you want---this will vary from sample to sample. For example, in the *Science Building* project, you would open the **ScienceBuilding** scene.

Here's an example of what you'll find in that scene:![](../../../media/get-started-developing-mesh/image007.png)

## Contributions

Mesh is a new product from Microsoft, and at this time we are not accepting code contributions to our samples.  If you have any feedback or if you run into any issues with the samples or the Mesh Toolkit, do the following: in a Unity project that has the Mesh Toolkit package installed, select **Mesh Toolkit** -> **Give feedback to Microsoft** and then use the feedback link in the Mesh Toolkit to let us know.
