# Web Content Overview

![Image of a Mesh environment with WebSlates on display.](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image002.png)![A picture containing screenshot,

Use WebSlate to display web content into your 3D Mesh Environment. Get a
full browsing experience on PC or Quest 2 with intuitive input,
customizability, security, and performance management. With Web Slates you
can:

- Display rich web content

- Configure display quality, brightness, and aesthetic components

- Experience built-in input across devices without extra work to enable it

- Drag-and-drop prefabs to show simple web slates or add scripted interactivity

- Manually authenticate to access secure content from within the experience

- Secure experiences with disabled local file access and cleared cookies, cache, and session state during initialization

In the Mesh Toolkit, the WebSlate prefab contains a URL parameter that
developers can specify to control the content displayed in their Mesh
Environment. Web slate can display Web pages and supports interaction but
does not function as a browser and does not support bookmark, history or
travel back-forth. Envision using web slates in your custom environments
for:

- Viewing dashboards, web pages, photos, and videos

- Showcasing content that highlights products and services,
    demonstrating expertise, customer stories, and brand identity

- Interacting with maps, diagrams, and data

To experience a WebSlate showcase within a Unity scene, see the
*HelloWorld-Unity.zip* sample on the EAP SharePoint site.

## Requirements/Dependencies

WebSlate dependsÂ on the *Unity.InputSystem* and
*Unity.XR.Interaction.Toolkit* Unity packages, located in the Mesh
Authoring package.

## Features

WebSlate loads an interactive page via a provided URL. The URL given to
it in the Environment will be the same one loaded in Mesh. WebSlate
offers the following features:

- When loaded on the Mesh App for PC and Quest, Web pages loaded by
    the WebSlate are interactable through mouse, keyboard, and Quest XR
    controller input.

- The size and shape of the web slate will match that of the quad
    GameObject on which it is placed, typically this is the quad baked
    inside of the prefab from the Mesh Authoring package.

- Multiple web slates can be added to a scene. The number of users in
    your Mesh Environment does not affect web slate performance, as
    WebSlate resources are initialized locally on the user's machine.

- Configure web slates with visual or cloud scripting to add interactive
    behaviors and synchronization across users.

- You can preview your web slate before uploading your scene to Mesh by
    hitting play in the Unity editor on your Environment project.

- For Web pages in which text rendering is more important, you can
    tune the image quality parameter to smooth out text. Note that an
    increase in quality can come at the cost of performance (memory
    consumption and frame rate). A good rule of thumb is to use high
    image quality for pages with lots of text that need to be read from
    a distance, low image quality for embedded images or videos, or text
    with fonts that are easily read from afar.

## Default Settings

By default, the WebSlate loads the preset URL. The URL should be replaced
with a desired one on each WebSlate in use. The brightness parameter is set to 1.0 (100% of the browser's
brightness).

![Unity usage of WebSlate](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image004.png)

## General Tips

- While WebSlate can be placed on Game Objects other than a Quad by
    adding *WebSlate.cs* as a script component directly to your 3D object
    of choice, visual texture stretching, inversion, and/or rotation may
    be seen.

### Performance

- As a WebSlate is a loaded Web page, it is important to consider
    performance implications:

  - Scenes are typically performant at 60fps with up to 15 web slates
        with Image Quality set to "Low." Framerate and general
        performance degradation may be observed in proportion to the
        number of web slates placed in a scene, regardless of content.

  - Each Web page displayed in a WebSlate may have different
        performance characteristics based on its contents and Image
        Quality setting.

  - While content is loaded and executed in the WebSlate on a thread
        separate to the scene's update and rendering thread(s) (and is
        therefore unlikely to directly affect framerate), it's still
        important to consider the cost of JavaScript running on a Web
        page both in terms of runtime complexity and memory usage.

  - When Mesh is loaded on Quest using the Android build, it is
        advisable to keep the number of WebSlates for which Image Quality
        is set to "High" under 5.

- Since web slates don't have any external navigation UI by default, the
    best practice is to only load custom URLs, where the site navigation
    is cyclic and can be done inside the page. This can be done with a
    navigation sidebar, or links to a hub page, for example.

- The Content Performance Analyzer (CPA) tool includes a WebSlate analyzer which measures the average time it takes Unity's render pipeline to render WebSlates in a frame.
  - Measurements are based on Unity's profiler recorder and requires playmode. The analyzer moves the camera over each WebSlate to collect sufficient profiler samples and calculates the average render time.

  - This provides a first-stage, high-level analysis of WebSlate render times in the context of Unity's render pipeline (it does not provide the frame rate of the WebSlate content itself).
  
  - If Unity's render pipeline exceeds the threshold to render WebSlates (currently 10ms), the CPA tool provides a warning.
  
  - The same measurements are also available to the Visual Profiler. The group on the Visual Profiler typically changes colors from green to red when the budget allowance for a category is surpassed. For now, the WebSlate group only shows as green until a reasonable render time budget is rationalized for WebSlates.

## Limitations/Issues

### Known issues

- When working with WebSlate in the Unity editor, the editor needs to be restarted when updating the WebSlate or Mesh Toolkit packages through the Unity package manager.

### General limitations

- WebSlates are currently supported in the Mesh App on PC Standalone, Quest 2, and for previewing in the Unity editor on Windows only.

- We are still working on automatic scaling and scale adjustments for content with different resolution requirements.

### Security restrictions

- WebSlates are locked to the URLs they navigate to, preventing malicious redirects. All unintended hyperlink navigations to outside domains are blocked.

- WebSlates are restricted to navigation within the initial domain or
    the specified URL's and server\'s redirections.

- Device access to webcam, microphone, and geolocation are blocked.

### Windows / PC Standalone

- When interacting with a web slate, Mesh may capture keyboard input causing unintended interactions with the Mesh app.

## Start with a sample

![WebSlate example in the Hello World sample.](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image005.png)

Did you know we have pre-made Mesh
Environments that you can download and use in Unity?

Check out the **Room Blue** scene in the **HelloWorld** sample! There
you can see web slates like this one and much more.

## Add a WebSlate to your Mesh Environment

Adding a WebSlate to your Environment should be a relatively
straightforward process so long as you have a Unity project set up to
create Mesh Environments or artifacts.

### Prerequisites

- Understand project setup in Unity covered in the E2E Environment Creation Guide.

- A username and password for the Azure Portal so you can upload your work.

- Your account must be added as a Content Contributor in the Mesh World you're trying to publish to. If you're unsure about this, check with your IT admin. There's more information about this in the next section.

- There must be an existing World that contains a Space in the Azure Portal that you can upload your work to. To learn more about setting this up, see our document titled "Custom Worlds -- IT Admin User Guide.

### Import the Mesh Toolkit Packages

If you haven't already imported the Mesh Toolkit, import it:

**com.microsoft.mesh.toolkit-X.X.X.tgz**

### Add a WebSlate prefab to your Unity project

There are two flavors of WebSlate prefabs available in the Mesh Toolkit that you can add to your scene. If you would like a WebSlate contained in a stylized frame with extra functionalities, you can use the WebSlateFramed prefab. Otherwise, if you would prefer a clean WebSlate with no extra components, you can use the WebSlate prefab.

![Image showcasing two webslate prefabs](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image025.png)

#### Using Mesh Toolkit Context Menu (Recommended)

To include either of the prefabs to your scene, right-click the scene hierarchy, navigate to "Mesh Toolkit," and then
click "WebSlate"/"WebSlateFrame". You can also click the "+" button at the top left of
the hierarchy window to see the same menu. Once you've added a WebSlate,
add a URL to display content in Mesh.

![Image of adding the Mesh Toolkit using the context menu](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image006.png)
![Add Mesh Toolkit to Hierarchy in Unity](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image007.png)

#### Using Mesh Toolkit Package

You can also find the WebSlate manually by navigating or searching for it
inside the Mesh Toolkit package. Search for "WebSlate" in your project, and
make sure you're searching inside "Microsoft Mesh Toolkit":

![Add prefab by searching in Mesh Toolkit](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image008.png)

Drag and drop the prefab into your scene, then add a URL to display on
the WebSlate:

![Add the WebSlateFramed prefab](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/WebSlate-Drag-Drop.png)

# Preview WebSlate in Unity Play Mode

To view a URL displayed in your WebSlate more quickly, you can use Unity
Play Mode. Aside from using the Play Mode, the only other way to see
your WebSlate is to upload it using the Mesh Toolkit Uploader and view it
in a Mesh experience.

In the Inspector window, add a URL to the WebSlate (Script) via the
Current URL property:

![Screenshot of unity WebSlate component with a url input into it. Web URL is bing.com](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image010.png)

Press the Unity editor Play button to view your Web page:

![Showcase both webslate prefabs in playmode](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image011.png)

## Enable WebSlate interaction for Unity Play Mode

To enable interaction in the WebSlate, you have to set up a few things.

1. Right-click in the scene hierarchy, navigate to "Mesh Toolkit," and then
    click "PlayModeSetup".

    ![Add playmode to your Unity scene](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image013.png)

    Ensure you see it in your scene, as shown here:

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically
    generated](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image014.png)

2. Create a new **Plane** GameObject. This will be your floor. Ensure the Game Object is positioned at the origin (0,0,0):
    
    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically  generated](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image015.png)

3. Position the WebSlate so it sits in front of the PlaymodeSetup
    character:

    ![A picture containing sky Description automatically generated](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image016.png)

4. Click the play button, and double click to interact with the Web
    page displayed in the WebSlate:

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image017.png)

**Great job! You added a custom WebSlate to your Unity scene and tested
the interaction in Unity Play Mode.**

**Now you're ready to upload the Environment to Mesh and share your
creation with the world!**

# WebSlate in Visual Scripting

Visual Scripting offers a \"no-code\" approach to adding behavior to a
scene. This means that developers can now implement WebSlate
functionality and behavior without the need for traditional programming.
Instead, a visual interface is provided, enabling users to define and
connect various actions and events in a scene. This simplifies the
process of adding interactivity and behavior, making it accessible to
individuals without extensive programming knowledge or experience.

To enable visual scripting using WebSlate, you must set up a few things.

1. Go to **Edit** \> **Project Settings**.

2. Select **Visual Scripting**.\
    ![A screenshot of Visual scripting page in Unity](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image018.png)

3. Expand **Node Library**.

4. At the end of the assemblies list, select **Add** (+).

5. In the new assembly entry, select **(No Assembly)** to open the
    **Assembly** menu.

6. Select **Microsoft.Mesh.WebSlate** from the **Assembly**
    menu\
    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
    generated](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image019.png)

    Visual Scripting adds the **Microsoft.Mesh.WebSlate** and its
    nodes to the Node Library. To use the nodes in your project, add
    **WebSlate** type to your Type Options and regenerate the Node Library.

    ![Screenshot of WebSlate from the assembly menu in Unity](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image020.png)

    After incorporating the WebSlate visual scripting node into your project,
    you can utilize it just like any other node in your visual script graph.
    Here\'s an example of a script graph that loads a new URL in WebSlate
    when the state of a graph variable changes.

    ![Showcase of WebSlate in Mesh visual scripting](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image021.png)

# WebSlate in Mesh Scripting

Developers now can add a WebSlate to their scripted worlds. This means
that a WebSlate can be navigated through a MeshApp script and therefore
synchronized across users. For example, create an app containing a
WebSlate node and one or more TouchSensor nodes. Then, you can set up
your TouchSensor's click event handler to navigate the WebSlate to a
different URL. By adding a Mesh App script to WebSlate, your users now
can update the WebSlate contents interactively.

![Showcase of web slates in Mesh Scripting](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/ArcadeWebSlate.png)

Refer to the [Visual scripting overview](../Scripting%20your%20scene%20logic/visual-scripting-overview.md) for further guidance on the WebSlate node in Mesh Apps.

# Feedback for web content in Mesh

![Screenshot of feedback button in the Mesh app](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image023.png)

We love feedback and bug reports! If you'd like to provide feedback, use the Feedback button inside any Mesh experience. This ensures that your feedback and bug reporting will be
triaged and incorporated quickly.

![Screenshot of the feedback button in the Mesh app](../../../media/webview-developer-guide/image024.png)

For WebSlate feedback, include "**\[web content\]**" or **a mention of WebSlate**
in your feedback.

If you're not able to give feedback or report bugs using the Feedback button in Mesh, use the Teams chats with your Microsoft partners, or contact your Microsoft partners directly.
