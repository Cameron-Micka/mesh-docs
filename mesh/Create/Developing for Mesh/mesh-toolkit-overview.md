# Mesh Toolkit overview

The Mesh Toolkit contains the packages you need to develop for Mesh. 

**Package:** Microsoft Mesh Toolkit / *com.microsoft.mesh.toolkit.-xxx.tgz*

The Toolkit includes (but isn't limited to):

- Cloud Scripting, used to add business logic to Mesh events via cloud
    hosted .NET applications.

- Graphics Tools, a package with scripts, shaders, assets, and samples
    created to help improve the visual fidelity of Mesh worlds while
    staying within performance budgets.

- Mesh Physics, used to create enabling and engaging dynamic content.

- The WebView prefab, to enable designers to add a panel that displays
    a given web page.

- Mesh.Toolkit.Playmode package, offering the possibility to press
    Play in a Mesh content project get a preview of what the content
    will look like running in Mesh.

- EventProduction scripts can be added to show hard-coded and online
    videos in an Event.

- Mesh Toolkit Uploader: used to build Mesh-compatible asset bundles
    from your Unity content and upload them to your Mesh World.

- Content Performance Analyzer (CPA): automatically reports content
    optimization issues and opportunities before content is uploaded to
    the Mesh catalog.

- Visual Scripting, which lets you add interactivity and dynamic
    runtime behavior to your Mesh environments without writing code. For
    more information, see our document titled "Mesh Visual Scripting
    Guide."
