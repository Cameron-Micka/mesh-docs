# Add more features

After you've created a basic Environment, take it to the next level by incorporating one or more of the features or technologies listed below. 

- With the **WebSlate** prefab, you can add panels to a scene
    that display static or interactive webpages. To learn more, see the article named [Add Web content](webcontent.md).

- **Shared Physics** simulation is key to enabling engaging dynamic
    content. The Mesh Physics system offers developers a productive
    workflow for creating custom content that will provide Mesh users
    with high-quality Mesh Physics experiences. To learn more, see the
    article named [Mesh Physics](physics-interactions.md). 

- With **Mesh Cloud Scripting** or **Mesh Visual Scripting**, you can
    assign behaviors to objects in the Environment, and the template
    itself, via C# scripts. To learn more, see the article named [Mesh Scripting overview](../script-your-scene-logic/mesh-scripting-overview.md)

- **Event content** integration: You can set up objects within your Environment to be controlled during an Event. When you use scripts in the Event Production folder of the Toolkit package, certain features will become available, such as [controlling animations with Timelines](animations-and-timelines.md). To set this up in your scene, see the article named [Add Event features to your environment](add-event-features). To learn more about producing events, see the article named *Mesh Event Producer Guide*. TBD.
