# Mesh Development Overview

The Mesh experience that you create in Unity starts out as a new project or existing sample; you can add content and then upload it to a world in the Azure Portal as an *Environment*. When a user creates a Mesh event for that world, they can choose to hold their event in the custom Environment you created.

In the Mesh documentation, you'll find articles that introduce you to the packages available for Mesh, walk you through the Unity setup, and describe the samples provided by Microsoft that you can use as a starting point for your Environment. 

## Terminology

In Unity, you create a new *project* which can contain one or more *scenes*. In Mesh terms, your scene will be viewed as an *Environment* which you must convert into an *asset* before uploading it to the Mesh Browser.
