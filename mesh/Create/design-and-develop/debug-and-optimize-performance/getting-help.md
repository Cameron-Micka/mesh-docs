# Getting Help

To better serve you, provide your Microsoft representative with the following information when experiencing issues with the Mesh developer experience.

- Uploader Version
- Metaverse ID
- Environment ID (if relevant)
- Is the issue consistent, intermittent or a one-off?
- Are there any errors or warnings in the Unity console?
- Have you restarted the Uploader and/or Unity?

## The Unity Editor log 

The Unity Editor log contains some extra logging that may not show up in the Console. The log can be retrieved with the following steps:

1. In Unity, navigate to the Console window.
1. Select the the three-dot button on the top right of the Console area, and then select Open Editor Log.
1. Save the file.
