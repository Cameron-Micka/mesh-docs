# Getting Started

You can create Mesh Experiences for two different platforms:

- Android, which is used on the Oculus Quest headsets.

- PC Desktops and Future Higher End Platforms

There are several ways to create Mesh Environments in Unity:

- Open and build upon an existing sample.

- Upgrade packages in a pre-existing Mesh project.

- Start a new project from scratch.

To learn about each of these approaches, see our article titled [Choose your journey](../getting-started/choose-your-journey.md). This will introduce you to the tools, show you how to create your first Mesh environment, and
teach you how to deploy it to users.

## Try our Mesh 101 tutorial

If you're new to Mesh and like the idea of learning through a
step-by-step tutorial, we recommend that you try our Mesh 101 tutorial.
It starts you off with a pre-built Unity project and then walks you
through the process of creating an educational windfarm experience.
You'll learn how to use Mesh scripting and physics to add interactivity,
and then you'll deploy the project as a metaverse Environment to your
Mesh World. To get started with the tutorial, see our article named [Mesh 101 tutorial: overview and setup](../getting-started/mesh-101-tutorial/mesh-101-01-overview-and-setup.md).
