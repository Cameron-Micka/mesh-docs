# Mesh Development Overview

The Mesh experience that you create starts out in Unity as a new project or existing sample. You can add content to the project/sample *scene* and then upload it to a World in the Azure Portal as an *Environment*. When an Event Producer creates a Mesh Event, they can choose to hold their Event in the custom Environment you created.

In the Mesh documentation, you'll find articles that introduce you to the packages available for Mesh, walk you through the Unity setup, and describe the samples provided by Microsoft that you can use as a starting point for your Environment.
