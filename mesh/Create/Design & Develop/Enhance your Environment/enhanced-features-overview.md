# Add more features

After you've created a basic Environment, take it to the next level by incorporating one or more of the features or technologies listed below. 

- **Graphics Tools** is a package providing scripts, shaders, assets,
    and samples created to help improve the visual fidelity of Mesh
    worlds while staying within performance budgets. To learn more, see
    the document named *Mesh 3D Design and Performance Guide. TBD

-   With the **WebView** prefab, you can add panels to a scene
    that display static or interactive webpages. Learn more at *Custom
    Worlds --* *WebView Developer Guide.pdf* TBD

- **Shared Physics** simulation is key to enabling engaging dynamic
    content. The Mesh Physics system offers developers a productive
    workflow for creating custom content that will provide Mesh users
    with high-quality Mesh Physics experiences. To learn more, see the
    document named *Mesh Physics Developer Guide. TBD

-   With **Mesh Cloud Scripting** or **Mesh Visual Scripting**, you can
    assign behaviors to objects in the Environment, and the template
    itself, via C# scripts. To learn more, see the document named *Mesh
    Scripting Developer Guide*. TBD

-   **Event content** integration: You can set up objects within your Environment to be controlled during an Event. When you use scripts in the Event Production folder of the Toolkit package, certain features will become available, such as [controlling animations with Timelines](animations-and-timelines.md). To set this up in your scene, see the article named [Add Event features to your environment](add-event-features). To learn more about producing events, see the article named *Mesh Event Producer Guide*. TBD.
