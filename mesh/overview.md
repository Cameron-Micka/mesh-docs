# Microsoft Mesh (Preview) overview

Welcome to the Microsoft Mesh Preview. Mesh enables people to connect with a holographic presence, share across space, and collaborate from anywhere in the world. By bringing [Mesh-enabled mixed reality experiences](get-started.md) to your organization, you can enhance virtual meetings, conduct virtual design sessions, help others remotely, and host immersive virtual meet-ups to boost productivity.

Mesh provides a natural collaboration experience in mixed reality, with 3D avatars representing people in a shared space. Proximity and spatial audio let people know where they are relative to one another. Users can visualize and annotate content together in a shared 3D space. A user can look at the person they're talking to and point to features on a shared 3D object.

See the Microsoft Mesh hands-on demo video below for an overview of Mesh and what it can do for you:

## Scenarios

### **Virtual collaboration**

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      Colleagues working time zones apart can collaborate as physically present in the same room. Mesh integrates with Microsoft 365, so connections, calendars, content, and workflows naturally transition to their Mixed Reality world. These shared experiences help deepen understanding, increase employee engagement and improve productivity.

### **Spatially aware design reviews**

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      Mesh enhances 3D design reviews by enabling users to join anywhere using any device. Whether physically present or holoported, colleagues can see and annotate 3D models in real time. All content persists between design sessions so teams can quickly start where they left off. This shared understanding ignites ideas, sparks creativity, and forms powerful bonds.

### **Help others remotely**

   :::column span="":::
      When employees need help, there is nothing like working with an expert in providing guidance and offering new perspectives. Mesh enables remote experts to be present wherever they are needed. They can overlay contextual data and help share insights quickly and effectively, resolving issues faster.

### **Train and learn together**

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      Training, especially on complex topics such as surgery, equipment maintenance, and traffic control, is hard without being in the same room with the instructor and looking at the same set of objects from multiple perspectives. With Mesh, employees can learn together from anywhere thanks to holoportation, holographic sharing, and visualization. Mesh helps improve the efficacy of virtual training while reducing travel and logistics costs.
