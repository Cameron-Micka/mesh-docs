# Microsoft Mesh overview

To support a truly flexible workplace, organizations and employees need technology that helps them feel connected regardless of where they work. Over the years, we have learned that a thriving workplace fosters authentic human connections—allowing employees and teams to build meaningful relationships and trust so they can perform at their highest potential.

According to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index report, 43 percent of leaders say relationship building is the [greatest challenge in remote and hybrid work](https://www.microsoft.com/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work). Coming together in a physical space helps, but it’s not always possible—travel costs are prohibitive, real estate is expensive, and talent is increasingly dispersed. We need new ways for people to connect from different locations or geographies, using the tools they already have.

## Introducing Microsoft Mesh

We are re-imagining the way employees come together with Microsoft Mesh, a new three-dimensional (3D) immersive experience.

Microsoft Mesh is not merely another innovation, but a solution that enables your distributed workforce to connect like never before in a 3D immersive space, helping virtual meetings and events feel more like face-to-face connections.

### Why immersive spaces?

Immersive spaces have unique attributes that create a perception of being physically together in a 3D digital space, including spatial interaction, co-presence, and immersion. Digital engagement is evolving from audio to video, and now to spatial interaction.

**Spatial awareness** through directionality and distance enables multiple small group discussions in the same place, adding familiar human elements to digital connections. Spending time in the same 3D environment also creates a powerful sense of togetherness, or co-presence, even without actively speaking.

**Co-presence** can lead to serendipitous moments of conversation or even just the deepened connection of a shared experience. 3D environments also remove distractions and help participants focus on fewer things—specifically the people and objects that surround them, driving a higher sense of immersion.

## Immersive spaces in Teams & Mesh

There are two ways to experience immersive spaces: **Immersive spaces in Teams** or **Immersive spaces in Mesh**.

Use ready-to-use environments or create custom-made environments with the Mesh Toolkit. Then customize your events with images, videos, or screen shares to deliver dazzling immersive experiences that can be experienced across devices, on PC or Meta headsets.

See [how to set up immersive spaces in Microsoft Mesh](Setup/Content/setup-m365-mesh.md).

### What can you do in immersive spaces in Mesh?

“All hands" presentations, social experiences in customized environments, and museum or booth-like experiences where people move from exhibit to exhibit.

- **Bring or create 3D models** to use in an interactable and navigable environment.

- **Interact with dynamic environments** with all participants simultaneously.

- **[Create compelling experiences](develop/development-overview.md#what-you-can-do-with-mesh)** using the Mesh Toolkit, leveraging Physics, scripting, and web content sharing. Leverage the power of Unity and the Mesh toolkit to [create custom immersive experiences that are tailored to your unique needs](develop/development-overview.md). Then upload them to Mesh and collaborate with people across the world.
