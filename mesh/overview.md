# Microsoft Mesh overview

## Introducing Microsoft Mesh

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RW1eO6Z]

We are re-imagining the way employees come together with [Microsoft Mesh](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/microsoft-mesh), powering several immersive experiences across the devices you use everyday.

Microsoft Mesh enables your distributed workforce to connect in 3D immersive experiences using Microsoft Teams, a PC, or Meta headset, helping virtual meetings and events feel more like face-to-face connections.

### Why immersive?

Immersive experiences have unique attributes that create a perception of being physically together in a 3D digital space, including spatial interaction, co-presence, and immersion. Digital engagement is evolving from audio to video, and now to spatial interaction.

**Spatial awareness** through directionality and distance enables multiple small group discussions in the same place, adding familiar human elements to digital connections. Spending time in the same 3D environment also creates a powerful sense of togetherness, or co-presence, even without actively speaking.

**Co-presence** can lead to serendipitous moments of conversation or even just the deepened connection of a shared experience. Focus on what matters; the people, conversations, and space you occupy should be our priority.

## Immersive spaces in Teams or custom immersive experiences?

- **Play as a team with pre-made icebreakers and activities** like prompt bubbles, marshmallow roasting, and bean bag toss.

- **Join right from Microsoft Teams** – a tool you use every day – bringing co-presence to hybrid or remote teams.

## Custom immersive experiences in Mesh

Use Microsoft Mesh for medium-to-large events with up-to 200 people to create custom experiences that are tailored to your specific business needs such as employee events, training, guided tours, or internal product showcases.

Use ready-to-use environments or develop custom environments with the Mesh Toolkit. Then customize your events with images, videos, or screen shares with in-experience no-code customization to deliver dazzling immersive experiences that can be experienced across devices, on PC or Meta headsets.

See [how to set up custom immersive spaces in Microsoft Mesh](Setup/Content/setup-m365-mesh.md).

### What can you do in custom immersive experiences?

- **Create and customize events that tell stories** by adding objects that can be used in your events with no-code in-experience tools like screen shares, images, and videos.

    :::image type="content" source="user-guide/media/Events-customization.gif" alt-text="Customization":::

- **Use Mesh on the web** to create or manage events, create event templates to be reused in the future, and manage all your uploaded environments. See [how collections are used to manage your uploaded environments](setup/Content/manage-mesh-on-web.md).

- **Integrate with M365** using a secure immersive app that is performant and highly customizable

#### Develop custom immersive experiences in Mesh

- **Bring or create 3D models** to use in an interactable and navigable environment.

- **[Rapidly create compelling 3D experiences](develop/development-overview.md#what-you-can-do-with-mesh)** using the Mesh Toolkit. Leverage the power of Unity and start fast with out-of-the-box capabilities like physics, scripting, and web content sharing provided by the Mesh toolkit to [create custom immersive experiences that are tailored to your unique needs](develop/development-overview.md).
