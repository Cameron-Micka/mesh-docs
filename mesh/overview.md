# Microsoft Mesh (Preview) overview

Welcome to the Microsoft Mesh Preview. Mesh enables people to connect with presence, share across space, and collaborate with one another, from anywhere in the world. By bringing [Mesh-enabled mixed reality experiences](get-started.md) to your organization, you can enhance virtual meetings, conduct virtual design sessions, help others remotely, and host immersive virtual meet-ups to boost productivity.

You can also [Join the Mixed Reality Developer Program](https://aka.ms/iwantmr) if you're interested in building a Mesh-enabled app.

Mesh provides a natural collaboration experience, in mixed reality. People are represented as 3D avatars in a shared space. Proximity and spatial audio let people know where they are relative to one another. Users can visualize and annotate content together in a shared 3D space. A user can look at the person they're talking to, and point to features on a shared 3D object.

## Scenarios

- **Virtual collaboration**: Colleagues working time zones apart can collaborate as if they're physically present in the same room. Mesh is integrated with Microsoft 365, so connections, calendars, content and workflows naturally transition to their Mixed Reality world. These shared experiences help deepen understanding, increase employee engagement and improve productivity.

- **Spatially aware design reviews**: Mesh enhances 3D design reviews by enabling users to join from anywhere using any device. Whether physically present or holoported, colleagues can see and annotate 3D models in real-time. All content persists between design sessions so teams can quickly start where they left off.  This common understanding ignites ideas, sparks creativity, and forms powerful bonds.

- **Help others remotely**: When employees need help, there is nothing like having an expert right next to them to provide guidance and offer new perspectives. Mesh enables remote experts to be present wherever they are needed. They can overlay contextual data and help share insights quickly and effectively,  resolving issues faster.

- **Train and learn together**: Training, especially on complex topics such as surgery, equipment maintenance, and traffic control, is hard to do without being in the same room with the instructor and looking at the same set of objects from multiple perspective. With Mesh, employees can learn together from anywhere thanks to holoportation, holographic sharing, and visualization. This helps improve the efficacy of virtual training while reducing travel and logistics costs.

- **Host virtual meet-ups**: Foster a deeper sense of connection and community, by hosting virtual meet-ups in Mesh-powered mixed reality experiences. Form powerful bonds with others by letting your personality shine through as technology fades away.
