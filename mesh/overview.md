# Microsoft Mesh overview

Microsoft Mesh enables people to build connections, share spaces, and collaborate from anywhere in the world by bringing [Mesh-enabled mixed reality experiences](get-started.md) to your organization like Avatars for Microsoft Teams.

Avatars for Microsoft Teams enables you to build connections in meetings without turning your video on. Include more people in the conversation — whether they need a break due to video fatigue or just feel more comfortable with their video off. Add a new layer of choice to your meetings. 

* **Choose how you’re represented** – Select from hundreds of combinations to customize an avatar that represents your physical attributes, wardrobe, accessories, and more. Choose how you express yourself with reactions. Save up to three avatars for different meeting types— such as casual, professional, or day-to-day. 

* **Build connections your way** – In addition to joining a meeting with your camera on and off, you can also join with an avatar. Combat video fatigue and include more people in the conversation, even those who are less comfortable with their video on. Avatars for Microsoft Teams gives you that much-needed camera break, while still allowing you to collaborate effectively. 

* **Stay in Teams** - Available within the Microsoft Teams experience. Once your avatar is created, it is just a few clicks away.  

Avatars for Microsoft Teams are now available in public preview. More information about how to get access to Avatars and participate in Teams public preview is available here:  [Public preview in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates).
