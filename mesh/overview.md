# Microsoft Mesh overview

To support a truly flexible workplace, organizations and employees need technology that helps them feel connected regardless of where they work. Over the years, we have learned that a thriving workplace fosters authentic human connections—allowing employees and teams to build meaningful relationships and trust so they can perform at their highest potential.

According to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index report, 43 percent of leaders say relationship building is the [greatest challenge in remote and hybrid work](https://www.microsoft.com/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work). Coming together in a physical space helps, but it’s not always possible—travel costs are prohibitive, real estate is expensive, and talent is increasingly dispersed. We need new ways for people to connect from different locations or geographies, using the tools they already have.

## Introducing Microsoft Mesh

We are re-imagining the way employees come together with Microsoft Mesh, a new three-dimensional (3D) immersive experience.

Microsoft Mesh is not merely another innovation, but a solution that enables your distributed workforce to connect like never before in a 3D immersive space, helping virtual meetings and events feel more like face-to-face connections.

Here’s what makes Mesh a powerful tool to bring your organization together:

### 3D digital environments—meaningful connections in shared spaces  

Immersive spaces have unique attributes that create a perception of being physically together in a 3D digital space, including spatial interaction, co-presence, and immersion. Digital engagement is evolving from audio to video, and now to **spatial interaction**.

Spatial awareness through directionality and distance enables multiple small group discussions in the same place, adding familiar human elements to digital connections. Spending time in the same 3D environment also creates a powerful sense of togetherness, or **co-presence**, even without actively speaking.

This co-presence can lead to serendipitous moments of conversation or even just the deepened connection of a shared experience. 3D environments also remove distractions and help participants focus on fewer things—specifically the people and objects that surround them, driving a higher sense of **immersion**.

## Immersive spaces in Teams or Mesh

With two major entrypoints to immersive experiences, one in Microsoft Teams through the View selector and one in the Microsoft Mesh application, what should you use?

## Use immersive spaces in Microsoft Teams

With [immersive spaces in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/4a6182f8-0f43-4c24-bb66-ef229fa221d8#ID0EBH=Microsoft_Teams), up-to 16 coworkers can hop into stunning pre-made virtual environments, offering icebreakers and activities with two clicks of a button, right from their Teams meeting.

Getting started is easy! From the **View menu** in a Teams meeting, select the immersive space option. With just a click, transform your two-dimensional (2D) meeting into a 3D immersive experience.

See [how to set up immersive spaces in Microsoft Teams today](/microsoftteams/meeting-immersive-spaces).

### What can you do in immersive spaces in Teams?

Casual team bonding get-togethers, virtual networking or onboarding meet-and-greet events, weekly scrum or standup with your team, brainstorming sessions with break-out groups

Immersive spaces in Teams is:

- **Low effort** to get set up and for users to get familiar with immersive experiences.

- **Integrated into Microsoft Teams** – a tool you use every day – bringing co-presence to hybrid or remote teams.

- **Provides Icebreakers and activities**, ready for you to enjoy and share with your teams.

Use immersive spaces in Mesh for medium-to-large events with up-to 200 people to create custom experiences that are tailored to your specific business needs such as employee events, training, guided tours, or internal product showcases.

Use ready-to-use environments or create custom-made environments with the Mesh Toolkit, and deliver engaging content to audiences with Mesh experience tools available from the Microsoft App Store or on Meta Quest.

See [how to set up immersive spaces in Microsoft Mesh](Setup/Content/setup-m365-mesh.md).

**Immersive spaces in Mesh** takes some more set up and preparation, supports up-to 200 people, and unlocks custom environments and experiences that can be tailored to your unique business needs. Add content in the app or create a custom environment in Unity, and join using the Microsoft Mesh application.

### What can you do in immersive spaces in Mesh?

“All hands" presentations, social experiences in customized environments, and museum or booth-like experiences where people move from exhibit to exhibit.

- **Bring or create 3D models** to use in an interactable and navigable environment.

- **Interact with dynamic** environments with all participants simultaneously.

- **[Create compelling experiences](develop/development-overview.md#what-you-can-do-with-mesh)** using the Mesh Toolkit, leveraging Physics, scripting, and web content sharing. Leverage the power of Unity and the Mesh toolkit to [create custom immersive experiences that are tailored to your unique needs](develop/development-overview.md). Then upload them to Mesh and collaborate with people across the world.

- **Customize and create events that tell stories** by adding objects that can be used in your events with no-code in-experience tools like screen shares, images, and videos.
    :::image type="content" source="user-guide/media/Events-customization.gif" alt-text="Customization":::

- **Integrate with M365** using a secure immersive app that is performant and highly customizable

- **Use Mesh on the web** to create or manage events, create event templates to be reused in the future, and manage all your uploaded environments. See [how collections are used to manage your uploaded environments](setup/Content/manage-mesh-on-web.md).
