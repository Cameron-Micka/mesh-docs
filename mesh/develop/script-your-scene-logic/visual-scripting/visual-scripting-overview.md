# Mesh Visual Scripting

## Overview

Read an [overview of Mesh Cloud Scripting and Mesh Visual Scripting](../mesh-scripting-overview.md)

If you're brand new to Mesh Visual Scripting, we recommend one or both of the following:

- Go through [Unity's Visual Scripting tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/introduction-to-visual-scripting). This teaches you most if not all of the concepts you need to get started with Mesh Visual Scripting.

- Go through our [Mesh 101 tutorial](../../getting-started/mesh-101-tutorial/mesh-101-01-overview-and-setup.md). Chapter 3 of the tutorial give you hands-on experience setting up three Mesh features using Visual scripting. The tutorial lists a prerequisite that you already have some Unity Visual Scripting knowledge; however, we've gotten feedback that some beginners have found the instructions easy to follow. If you go through the Unity tutorial linked above, this should prepare you sufficiently for the tutorial.

Otherwise, there's no special setup needed&#8212;you can just start scripting!
