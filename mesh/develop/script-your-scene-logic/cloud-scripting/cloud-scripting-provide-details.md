# Set up Mesh Cloud scripting on your system

In order to use Mesh Cloud scripting in your Mesh experience, there are three things you must do:

1. Deploy the Mesh Cloud Scripting Service cloud infrastructure to Azure.
2. Set up your development environment.  
1. Provide cloud scripting details when you build and publish your experience.

In this article, you'll learn about Step #3: provide cloud scripting details when you build and publish your experience.



As a reminder, MeshApp is an app service that you'll be adding to your project to support multiplayer interactivity.

... and then do the following:

- Copy the subscription ID that you obtained earlier for MeshApp (see the Prerequisites section named Mesh Scripting setup information) and then paste it into the Subscription ID field.  
- Enter a Resource Group or let the project choose one for you (details on this are also in the Prerequisites section).  
- You can accept the default Location or choose a different one.

- When you're finished, close the Project Settings window.
