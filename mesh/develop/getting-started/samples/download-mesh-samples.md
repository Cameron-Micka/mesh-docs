# Download Mesh samples

The Mesh toolkit samples repo on GitHub contains a variety of Mesh sample projects to inspire you about what you can build with Microsoft Mesh.

1. In your browser, go to GitHub, and then navigate to the [*Mesh-Toolkit-Unity* repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Mesh-Toolkit-Unity).

1. Select the **Code** button, and then select **Download ZIP**.

1. On your C: drive, create a folder with a one-word name (for example, "Mesh101") and then move or copy the downloaded Mesh toolkit Zip file to that folder. This is done to avoid running into a problem with the Windows path length limit, which is 256 characters. **IMPORTANT**: *Don't* place the Zip file on the Windows desktop. Behind the scenes, this creates a very long path name.

    In the example below, the user created a folder on their C: drive named *Mesh101.* Next, they moved the downloaded Mesh toolkit Zip file to the *Mesh101* folder
