# Microsoft Mesh Toolkit Sample: Physics Effects Gallery

![Gallery View](../../../media/samples/001-physics-effects-gallery.png)

The *PhysicsEffectsGallery* project (scene: *PhysicsEffectsGallery*) contains a programmer-art designed scene that demonstrates the power of combining appealing visuals with the creative use of Mesh Physics features found in the Mesh Toolkit. Feel free to inspect, modify and play with the scene or use elements to creatively enhance your own custom experiences!

In this project, you'll find:

* **Default game physics**: demonstrating shapes, constraints and restitution
* **Explosions**: configured with different parameters (both spherical and directional)
* **Velocity fields**: showing different options to move objects 
* **Throwing objects**: with ball or dart-like behavior
* **Visual Scripting examples**: for 3D button and slider UI elements
* **Mass and Gravity**: scaled gravity or objects orbiting around the sun
* **Buoyancy**: objects floating on the waves

Additonally, there are several **unpolished** game mechanics examples:

* **Pinball**, **Bowling**, **Air Hockey**, **Balancing Maze**, **Fishing Game**, **Baseball Cage**, **Mini Golf**, **Cannon Shooting** and the **Toy Cars**.

The [Samples Overview](samples-overview.md) page contains instructions on how to download the Mesh Toolkit which contains this sample.

## Contributions
