# Enhanced features overview

After you've created a basic Environment, take it to the next level by incorporating one or more of the features or technologies listed below. 

* [Mesh physics](physics-interactions.md), used to create enabling and engaging dynamic content.

* [Mesh interactables](avatar-and-object-interactions/interactables.md), allowing participants to grab, hold, throw, select, anchor, tether and spawn

* [Mesh controllables](multi-room-sync.md), enabling event hosts to control and sync video and timeline playback across multiple rooms of a large event.

* [Mesh web slates](webcontent.md), enabling designers to add a panel that displays a given web page.
