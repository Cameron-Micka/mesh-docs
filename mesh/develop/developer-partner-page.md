### About us

We want to make our world more human by connecting lives. In Telefónica, we believe that it´s people who give meaning to technology and not the other way around
At a time when technology is more present than ever in our lives, we cannot forget that the most important connections are human connections. Because in today’s society, people’s quality of life, mostly depends on that connection.

And this is where we come in. Offering connections that bring people together, rather than isolate them; connections that invite people to be themselves, to express themselves, to share.

Offering connections that bring people together
Our mission puts people at the center of everything we do. We want to be a company that customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and society in general can trust.

This mission commits us to protecting people and the planet, as well as ensuring that social corporate responsibility is at the core of everything we do. We aspire to digitize the entire society, leaving no one behind, thus aligning ourselves naturally with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, which highlights the key role of technology, innovation and communications in addressing humanity’s great challenges.
