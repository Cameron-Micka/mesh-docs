## Add more Environments for build and publish

If you want to Build & Publish more than one Environment, click on **Add Environment Configuration** button and make sure you have the correct Environment and scene selected (you can see the details on the steps from [Configure the Environment for build and publish](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mesh-docs-pr/blob/main/mesh/develop/make-your-environment-available-for-events/build-and-publish-your-environment.md#configure-the-environment-for-build-and-publish)).

Environments that are already selected will be disabled.

Sometimes the list of the available Environments can be big. Use these 2 filters to help sort environments:

### Filter Environments by Worlds

By default you can see Environments from all the Worlds you have access, you can filter the list by specifying one specific World.
