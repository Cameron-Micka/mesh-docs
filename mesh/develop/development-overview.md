# Mesh Development Overview

Your custom Mesh immersive space starts out in Unity as a new project or existing sample. You can add content to the project/sample *scene* and then upload it to a world in the Mesh portal as an *environment*. When an organizer creates a Mesh event, they can then choose to hold their event in the custom environment you created.

In this section, you'll find articles that introduce you to the features of Mesh toolkit, walk you through Unity setup, and describe the samples provided by Microsoft that you can use as a starting point for your environment.

## Develop in Unity with Mesh toolkit

The Mesh toolkit for Unity provides a collection of features that enable you to develop rich interactive worlds that help immerse users in scenarios where technology can empower you to build a better remote and hybrid work environment.

**The Mesh toolkit includes:**

* [Mesh graphics tools](design/overview.md), a collection of scripts, shaders, assets, and samples created to help improve the visual fidelity of Mesh worlds while staying within performance budgets.

* [Mesh physics](enhance-your-environment/physics/physics-interactions.md), used to create enabling and engaging dynamic content.

* [Mesh interactables](enhance-your-environment/avatar-and-object-interactions/interactables.md), allowing participants to grab, hold, throw, select, anchor, tether and spawn

* [Mesh controllables](enhance-your-environment/multi-room-sync.md), enabling event hosts to control and sync video and timeline playback across multiple rooms of a large event.

* [Mesh web slates](enhance-your-environment/webcontent.md), enabling designers to add a panel that displays a given web page.

* [Mesh visual scripting](script-your-scene-logic/visual-scripting/visual-scripting-overview.md), which lets you add interactivity and dynamic runtime behavior to your Mesh environments without writing code.

* [Mesh cloud scripting](script-your-scene-logic/cloud-scripting/cloud-scripting-basic-concepts.md), which lets you connect to real-time backend data and call .NET APIs via cloud-hosted server scripts.

* [Mesh play mode](debug-and-optimize-performance/playmode.md), which lets you press Play in a Mesh content project to preview how your content will look like running in Mesh for multiple users.

* [Mesh uploader](make-your-environment-available/build-and-publish-your-environment.md), used to build Mesh-compatible asset bundles from your Unity content and upload them to your Mesh World.

* [Mesh Content Performance Analyzer](debug-and-optimize-performance/cpa.md) (CPA): automatically reports content optimization issues and opportunities before content is uploaded to the Mesh catalog.

The Mesh Toolkit is free to download; however a Teams Premium license is required for all users (including developers and technical 3D artists) to use Microsoft Mesh.

Build environments in Unity and then upload to the the Mesh portal. Within the Mesh application, bring your environment to life and lead attendees through stage-managed events with rich host tooling for customization and event moments.
