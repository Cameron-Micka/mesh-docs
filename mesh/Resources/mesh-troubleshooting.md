# Troubleshooting for Microsoft Mesh

## How to download Mesh on Quest 2 via App Lab

Microsoft Mesh (Preview) for Meta Quest devices is available through AppLab.

If you had previously downloaded the **Napili** app on your Quest 2 device, you should move to the new app available at the link below.

**Napili** will be deprecated in lieu of the new Microsoft **Mesh (Preview) app**.

1. On your PC, visit the link below to download Mesh on Quest 2.

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Microsoft Mesh (Preview) on Oculus Quest 2 \| Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8919580184782498/)

    If the URL doesn't work, use a new private window in your browser.

2. Sign in with your **Meta device account** (*not* your corporate AAD account). This could be your Meta ID, Facebook account, or another
    email.
