# Mesh release notes

**Release notes and known issues for the Microsoft Mesh App on PC & Quest 2**

## Version 2023-8-29

### What's new

#### Environment Editor panel is now available

The Environment Editor panel can help to add content to your Event or Template. 

1.	Open the Environment Editor panel from the app bar, then you can add images, videos, and text to your environment. These are called Artifacts.

Artifacts can be used to add branding to make the event environment feel unique to your event. Also, artifacts can be used with the Control Panel to highlight content as part of your presentations or serve as moments to your event flow.

For example, as you welcome new members to your team during your event, you can post a few pictures of them around the stage so everyone can put a name to the new faces.
