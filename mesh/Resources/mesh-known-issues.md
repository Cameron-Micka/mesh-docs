# Active known issues - Mesh

## Version 2023-9-8

* When downloading the Mesh app from Microsoft Store, some users will get a blank screen in the web browser. To search for the most current data on the server, press the **CTRL + F5** keys to clear your browser cache.  The latest version of the Microsoft store webpage will then load. (14921)
* On Quest, users will see a black lobby screen background after they leave the headset idle in a meeting. (54774)
* Buttons in the **Manage events** dialog can occasionally fail to respond. Scrolling with the scrollbar on the right will fix the problem. (53895)
