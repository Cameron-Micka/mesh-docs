# Feedback and support

We would love for you to provide us with feedback and bug reports!

There are two ways to provide feedback for Mesh:

## Product feedback for Mesh

For product feedback, use the **Feedback** button inside your Mesh experience. This ensures that your feedback and bug reporting will be triaged and incorporated quickly.

## Developer feedback for Mesh

For feedback on the development experience, once you've [downloaded the Mesh toolkit](../Create/build-your-basic-environment/add-the-mesh-toolkit-package.md), use the **Mesh toolkit** > **Feedback** menu dropdown to provide feedback.

We truly appreciate feedback!
