# Get started with the Mesh app on your HoloLens 2 (Preview)

The Microsoft Mesh app (Preview) is a collaboration-first experience for HoloLens 2, built on [Microsoft Mesh services](../overview.md). With the Mesh app, you can create spaces to work with others in your organization. You'll get a more natural and productive collaboration experience, with the feeling of being in the same room while working from different locations.
