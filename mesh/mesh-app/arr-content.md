# Azure Remote Rendering (ARR) content

If you want to load new Azure Remote Rendering (ARR) objects into a space, you will need to enable the **ARR** option in **Experimental Features** by going through the following steps:  

1. Look at your hand to [bring up the menu](use-mesh.md#the-hand-menu), and press the **Main menu** button at the top.
1. Go to **Settings** tab, and select **Experiments**.

1. You can now see a tab for Azure Remote Rendering objects in your **Content** menu.

Any ARR objects that you place in a space will be visible to all users in that space.  

To import your own content for remote rendering, you will first need to upload and process your models, see [Quickstart: Convert a model for rendering](/azure/remote-rendering/quickstarts/convert-model).  To import your models into the Mesh app, see steps below:

1. Go into your OneDrive directory online, preferably on your PC.
1. Go to Apps > Microsoft Mesh app (Preview) > MyContent folder on your OneDrive.
1. If youâ€™ve enabled **ARR** in the Mesh app, there should be a `.json` file called `remote_models.json`.
1. Edit this `.json` file to give your model a name and add the [URI token address generated for your ARR model](/azure/remote-rendering/quickstarts/convert-model#insert-new-model-into-quickstart-sample-app).
