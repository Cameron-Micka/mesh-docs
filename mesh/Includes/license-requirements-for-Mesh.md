### License requirements for Immersive spaces in Mesh

For Microsoft Mesh, you will need the following:

- Teams Premium license in a tenant for Commercial use. Read more about [Microsoft Teams Premium licensing - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams).

    > [!NOTE]
    > We don't support tenants with worldwide public sector, EDU, or GCC licenses.

- A pre-requisite license in Teams Premium, as outlined in [Requirements to purchase Teams Premium - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams#what-are-the-requirements-to-purchase-teams-premium).

Learn more about [Teams for enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/enterprise#pricing) and [Teams Premium trial license](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams#can-i-experience-teams-premium-before-buying-licenses).

#### Allow SharePoint Group, M365 Calendar, OneDrive

> [!NOTE]
> All Teams Premium prerequisite licenses include Sharepoint, OneDrive, and M365 Calendar.

To use Mesh events, your organization needs to have SharePoint and M365 Calendar. You'll need to talk with your admin to ensure you have the following allowed for anyone associated with a Mesh event (including developers, event organizers, and event attendees/users):

- **Group creation**: Used for Mesh World creation in the Mesh Portal.
- **SharePoint/OneDrive**: Used for custom event/template creation.
- **Mailbox/Calendar**: Used for events creation and/or sending/receipt of event invites.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A user with Teams premium license but without an Office license
>
> 1. Cannot create a world
> 1. Cannot create an event
> 1. Cannot be invited to an event
> 1. Can be added to an existing world
> 1. Can manage event templates (create/duplicate/delete etc.) in an existing world
