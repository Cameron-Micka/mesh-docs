# IT admin-led trials for Microsoft Mesh

This article describes how to set up and run an IT Admin-led trial pilot program to deploy Microsoft Mesh in your organization.

## Getting started

There are a few steps to take before initiating your Microsoft Mesh trial. First, we need to ensure your organization is set up to run Microsoft Mesh by:

To sign up for a trial, please visit either:

- Visit the [Preparing your organization for Microsoft Mesh](preparing-your-organization.md) page to accomplish the required tasks and assign the suggested functional roles that may be involved a rollout.

- Complete the prerequisite steps in our [Guide to set up Microsoft Mesh with M365](setup-m365-mesh.md).

There are licensing requirements and configuration steps needed prior to beginning your Microsoft Mesh trial. The trial start date initiates from the date the trial licenses are activated in Microsoft 365 Admin Center so please ensure your organization is configured to run Microsoft Mesh prior to initiating the trial.

## Sign up for a trial

Trials are publicly available from one of the following sources. These IT Admin trials offer customers access to Microsoft Mesh for 6 months.
To sign up for a trial, please visit either:

- [Microsoft Mesh - Home](https://www.microsoft.com/mesh)
- [M365 Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
    1. Sign in to [https://admin.microsoft.com/](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
    1. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase Services**.
    1. Scroll down to the **Microsoft 365** section or search for Microsoft Mesh.
    1. On the **Microsoft Mesh Trial** title, select **Details**.
    1. Select **Get free trial**.
    1. Follow the remaining steps to confirm the trial.

These admin-led trials are not available worldwide. They aren't available for Government customers or customers with EDU or FLW SKUs. See the [Mesh Troubleshooting and FAQs](../../Resources/mesh-troubleshooting.md) for full licensing requirements.

Based on customer tenant configuration, some customers may be unable to see the Microsoft Mesh trial if searching directly in Microsoft 365 admin center. Following the Microsoft Mesh trial link (AKA.MS LINK) from the [Microsoft Mesh Homepage](https://www.microsoft.com/mesh) will take those customers directly to the trial location.

The expiration date appears in the trial subscription details page within the Microsoft 365 admin center. Upon expiration of the trial, the user won't be able to access their content in Microsoft Mesh and will have to reach out to their IT Admin to purchase a paid license for themselves and their business groups.

## Activate a trial

When you initiate a trial, you need to:

- Ensure your organization is configured to run Microsoft Mesh
- Assign licenses to the relevant users
- Educate organizational stakeholders how to get started hosting Mesh events

For more information on preparing your organization for Microsoft Mesh, please see [Preparing your organization](preparing-your-organization.md)

For more information on setting up Mesh events, please see our Events overview page at [Mesh events overview](../../events-guide/events-overview.md).

## During a Trial

During the Mesh trial, we suggest you evaluate the following:

- Host Mesh events in the ready-made immersive spaces or customize your own space by adding visual elements like banners featuring your organization’s logo, videos showcasing your product, or presentation content with the no-code editor.

- Explore and deploy customized 3D experiences in Microsoft Mesh using the Mesh toolkit available for Unity.

For more adoption and deployment resources, visit our Mesh Adoption page found (LINK TO ADOPTION PAGE)

For more information on setting up Mesh events, please see our Events overview page at [Mesh events overview](../../events-guide/events-overview.md).

## After a Trial

Based on the outcome of the trial, you can decide whether to proceed to purchase licenses of Teams Premium to access Microsoft Mesh.
To ensure continuity of service, you must purchase the required number of licenses and assign those licenses to users. Trial users who don't have a full license at the end of the trial period won't be able to access any Microsoft Mesh experiences.

If you don't purchase licenses following the trial:

- Users will no longer be able to access Microsoft Mesh.
- Users will continue to have access to the Mesh toolkit in Unity but will be unable to access the Microsoft Mesh application to publish and experience your environments in Mesh.
