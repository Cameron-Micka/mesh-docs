# Manage Mesh worlds

The Mesh portal is where you can create Mesh events and invite co-organizers or attendees, and also manage environments and templates.  Before you can upload custom environments and create templates, you'll need to create a Mesh world to hold them.

## Prerequisites

Microsoft 365 Admins should use the M365 Apps Admin Center to enable the Mesh access policy for users to make the Mesh Portal accessible. If the Mesh Portal is not accessible to you, you may need to ask your IT Admin or wait for the policy to be available for your organization.

[See how to set up Mesh experiences in M365](setup-m365-mesh.md).

## Set up Mesh worlds

Mesh worlds are the home for your custom environments that you upload through the Mesh Toolkit Uploader in Unity, as well as event templates that you create in Mesh for reuse.

You can assign the following to a Mesh world:

- **Owners**: Can manage membership and change settings for the world.
- **Members**: Can access and manage event templates and use the customization session to customize environments in the Mesh App.

### Create a Mesh world

1. Open the [Mesh Portal](https://portal.mesh.microsoft.com/).
1. In the Home page, select **Worlds** in the left nav.
    :::image type="content" source="../../media/m365-migration-guide/Select-world.png" alt-text="Select worlds in left nav home page":::
1. Select **Create World** in the top right.
1. Fill out the **World name**, **Description**, and add **Owners**, and **Members**.
    - **Owners**: Can manage membership and change settings for the world.
    - **Members**: Can access and manage event templates and use the customization session to customize environments in the Mesh App.
1. Select **Create world**.

Now your Mesh world is created, you can now upload environments from the Mesh Toolkit Uploader to your Mesh world and create events.

## Next steps

Now that you've set up Microsoft Mesh, dive in to organize your first Mesh event:

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Organize your event in the Mesh app](../../events-guide/events-overview.md)

If you have skills using Unity, get started building your own custom environment for your new Mesh world:

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Develop Mesh environments](../../develop/development-overview.md)
