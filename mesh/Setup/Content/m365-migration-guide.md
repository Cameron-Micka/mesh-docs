# M365 migration guide

The Microsoft Mesh setup experience is moving from Azure to M365. With this migration, the admin management of Mesh will be done primarily in the Mesh Portal.

For now, we are migrating customers carefully. If you are migrating to M365 from Azure and beginning to use the Mesh Portal, continue reading to see how.

## Mesh Portal

In the Mesh Portal, admins will be able to manage:

- Mesh worlds
- Events and attendees
- Custom environments
