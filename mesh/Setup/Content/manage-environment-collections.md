# Manage Mesh on the web

Use Mesh on the web to create events, invite co-organizers or attendees, manage environments and templates, and create collections to hold custom environments. Before you can [upload custom environments](../../develop/make-your-environment-available/build-and-publish-your-environment.md) and [create templates](../../events-guide/create-template.md), you'll need to create a Collection to hold them.

## Prerequisites

Microsoft 365 Admins should use the M365 Apps Admin Center to enable the Mesh access policy for users to access Mesh on the web. If Mesh on the web is not accessible to you, you may need to ask your IT Admin or wait for the policy to be available for your organization.

## Overview of Collections

> [!NOTE]
> Collections use a M3

Collections are the home for your custom environments that you upload through the Mesh Toolkit Uploader in Unity, as well as [Templates that you create](../../events-guide/create-template.md) in Mesh for reuse.

In Mesh on the web, the **Home** page shows a few useful articles and upcoming events.

- **Events:** [Create or manage events](../../events-guide/create-event-mesh-portal.md) that are joined view the Microsoft Mesh application.
- **Environments:** View and manage the environments available from Microsoft or view the environments and Templates from collections.

## Next steps

Now that you've set up Microsoft Mesh, dive in to organize your first Mesh event:

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Organize your event in the Mesh app](../../events-guide/events-overview.md)

If you have skills using Unity, get started building your own custom environment for your new Collection:

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Develop Mesh environments](../../develop/development-overview.md)
