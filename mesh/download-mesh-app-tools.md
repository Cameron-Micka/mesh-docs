# Download Mesh apps and tools

```suggestion
Mesh has a stable build where most users will experience immersive experiences and a corresponding stable toolkit for developers who wish to create custom environments or artifacts to be used in those immersive experiences.

Mesh also has a separate preview build and preview toolkit. These are ideal for developers who want to test out upcoming features and prepare in advance for the next stable build.

At a regular cadence we promote the preview build to the stable public build. At this time, this happens every 3 weeks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure you are on the app version that your event organizer intends for you to use. The preview versions of Mesh are typically intended for testing out new features, whereas the normal app is intended for general usage.
