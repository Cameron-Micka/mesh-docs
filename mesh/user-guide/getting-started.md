# Getting started with Microsoft Mesh

To support a truly flexible workplace, organizations and employees need technology that helps them feel connected regardless of where they work. Over the years, we have learned that a thriving workplace fosters authentic human connectionsâ€”allowing employees and teams to build meaningful relationships and trust so they can perform at their highest potential.

Immersive spaces have unique attributes that create a perception of being physically together in a 3D digital space, including spatial interaction, co-presence, and immersion. Digital engagement is evolving from audio to video, and now to spatial interaction. Spatial awareness through directionality and distance enables multiple small group discussions in the same place, adding familiar human elements to digital connections.

Spending time in the same 3D environment also creates a powerful sense of togetherness, or co-presence, even without actively speaking. This co-presence can lead to serendipitous moments of conversation or even just the deepened connection of a shared experience.
