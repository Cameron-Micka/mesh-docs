# Manage an event

There are several things you can do at least **one hour before** you
start your event:

- Invite guests or collaborators
- Edit or delete event
- Customize the event
- Provision the event (in multiple room events)

*You must complete any of these actions before your event. Once a guest
joins the event, you won't be able to customize your event anymore.*

**Open the Manage event page:**

On the **Manage Events** page, you can invite guests to your event, edit
event details, or join the event. Everything but the environment and
room/session scale can be edited.

## Invite guests or collaborators

The participants you can invite fall into two categories:
*collaborators* and *guests*.

- A *guest* is only allowed to participate in an immersive event.

- A *collaborator* can create, configure, and manage an event, but
    must have Content contributor privileges provided by an IT Admin in
    Azure.

    ... and then select **Invite Guests**.

2. On the **Invite Guests** page, add your guests to the **Search for
    people** text box.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
> You can add names individually or copy and paste a comma-delimited
> list of email addresses. Single room environments can have 16 while
> multiple room environments can have up to 200 total participants.

3. If there are any invalid emails, search for them and remove them.
    When you've finished adding names and all invitees are valid, click
    **Send**.

**These invitees will now see the event in Mesh. Great job! Invite some
collaborators to help you invite people or customize the event with
in-experience tools.**

### To invite collaborators

1. Click the Invite button and then select **Edit Collaborators**.

2. On the **Invite Collaborators** page, add your guests to the
    **Search for people** text box. You can add names individually or
    copy and paste a list. The maximum number of participants is 15.

## Edit or delete your event

### To edit your event details

1. Click the **Options** button.

    then click the **Next** button.

2. Select **Delete**.

3. In the dialog that appears, click the **Confirm** button.

## Multiple Rooms event

If you choose a multiple rooms event, there's one more step you must
take before you run a meeting.

### Provision your event

You must provision your event **at least 30 minutes before** the meeting
starts. This initiates all setup on the backend to ensure your multiple
rooms event goes smoothly.

**Open the Manage event page:**

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically
 generated](../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image018.png)

1. In the Manage events page, your Multiple Rooms event will show a
    **Provisioning required** note:

2. Select the event to access the **Overview** page, then select the **Provision button**.

    > [!IMPORTANT] 
    > You may need to select Provision a few times. Please re-select **Provision** if you've refreshed the event and it still shows Provision instead of Provisioned.

3. While provisioning, the button will show **In Progress**.

4. Refresh the event periodically to ensure that provisioning was
    completed. You may need to Provision again if the button shows
    **Provision**.

    Once it shows **Provisioned**, you're ready to host your event!

## Start your event

Now that you've created your event, invited participants, and edited the
event settings, the event should be ready for participants to join.

*Great job!*

Invitees should see the event in Mesh and be able to join close to the
event start time.

## Customize your event

If you'd like to customize your event before participants join, join a collaboration session in Mesh to add custom artifacts to your environment that you can use while running your event.

See the [Considerations before starting your event](customize-event.md) to learn more.
