# Produce your event

## Considerations before starting your event

**Customize before your event:** To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize the event
at least one hour before the event should start.

**Provision event for multiple room events:** If you've chosen a Multiple rooms event, ensure that you've provisioned
your Multiple Rooms event at least 30 minutes before the event start
time.

*Provisioning is necessary to enable broadcasting between rooms as the
event host.*

See the [Provision Multiple Rooms event](#provision-multiple-rooms-before-the-event) section for more
info.

## Event Producers tools

- **Host Panel:** See the participants in your event and use the host panel toolbar to access the *Mute all*, *Megaphone*, *Broadcast*, and  *Share* buttons.

- **Control Panel:** Control the elements you add to the environment with scripted sequences of events. Imagine a curtain raise to signal the start of the event!

- **Event templates:**  Create a template of your event with all customizations that you add to reuse in future events

## Producing your event

After you've created your event and customized it, it's time to join and produce your event.

    1. Open the app, find the event, and join the event.
