# Produce your event

## Considerations before starting your event

### Customize **before** your event

To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize and save customizations at least 30 minutes before the event start time.

### Event capacity

- 200 attendees per event
- 16 attendees per room
- Up to 16 hosts in a separate room, additional to the 200 attendees

## Event Producers tools

- **[Host panel:](#host-panel)** See the participants in your event and use the host panel toolbar to access the *[Mute all](#mute-all)*, *[Megaphone](#megaphone)*, *[Broadcast](#broadcast)*, and  *[Share](#share)* buttons.
- **[Control panel](#control-panel):** Control the elements that were added in a Customization session. [Play a video](#control-artifacts-in-the-control-panel), for example, or control custom artifacts that you may have added!

## Join the event

After you've created your event, customized it, and added content to the control panel, it's time to join and produce your event.

> [!TIP]
> **Ensure that you've [customized your event](customize-event.md) properly** (added custom content or artifacts to your environment, added it to the control panel, and saved) before producing your event.

1. Open the Mesh app directly or use the link your calendar invite to open the Mesh app.

1. Find your event in the **Upcoming** or **Happening now** sections, and select **Join**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Join-now-events.png" alt-text="Join now button in the Microsoft Mesh app":::

    > [!NOTE]
> As a host, you'll join into a Host Room along with any other co-organizers. Attendees will be in their own room(s).

1. Adjust your device settings to ensure they're set up properly.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Device-settings-setup-before-join.png" alt-text="Device settings adjustment  inside pre-join window for Mesh event.":::

Once you select **Join now**, you'll utilize two main tools, Host panel and the Control panel, for your run of show:

## Host panel

1. Select the **Host panel** button in the menu bar.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Host-panel-button-overview2.png" alt-text="Host panel button to see participant list and tools":::

1. In the window that opens, you'll see the following tools at the top:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/host-tools-bar.png" alt-text="Host panel tool bar":::

### Host panel tools

### Mute all

Mute all attendees in the event. Hosts in the event can still use their mics and mute or unmute.

**Enabled:** Attendees are muted and cannot mute or unmute.

**Disabled:** Attendees can now use their microphone.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-mute-button.png" alt-text="Mute all button in host panel":::

#### Megaphone

Amplify your voice to all participants in the event. A great tool when broadcasting or using a screenshare.

**Megaphone and Broadcast enabled:** Host voice is amplified to all participants in all rooms.

**Megaphone enabled:** Host voice is amplified to all participants in the Host's room only.

**Disabled:** Host voice is not amplified. Only participants close to the host will hear the host.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-megaphone-button.png" alt-text="Megaphone button in host panel":::

#### Broadcast

Use broadcast anytime you wish to be seen/heard by your whole audience. Broadcasted avatars are visually distinguished by a purple-rings effect applied to their avatar.

**Enabled:** Host avatar and voice are broadcast to all rooms in the event.

**Disabled:** Host avatar and voice are not broadcasted to all rooms.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-broadcast-button.png" alt-text="Boradcast button in a Mesh event in the host panel":::

> [!NOTE]
> Only three hosts can broadcast at the same time.

#### Share

Share your screen or a specific window on your PC to all participants. Screenshare requires the Screenshare artifact that is [added when you customize your Event or Event Template](customize-event.md#add-content-with-environment-editor).

**Enabled:** Host screen or window will be shown to all participants.

**Disabled:** Host screen or window is not shown.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-screenshare.png" alt-text="Share button in host panel":::

> [!NOTE]
> As with Microsoft Teams, an organizer will not see their active screen share. However, all non-sharing attendees will be able to see the screen share.

**How to screenshare:**

1. Select the **Screenshare** button in the menu bar at the top.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-screenshare-button-pushed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app, host panel open, screenshare selected.":::

1. Select the monitor screen or window that you want to share.

1. You will have two notifications visible to indicate that you are screensharing.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-screenshare-in-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing host panel open, screenshare started.":::
1. Stop sharing your screen by selecting the Share button again at the top of host panel.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-screenshare-stop.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing stop sharing button in host panel.":::

### Social panel

See the event participants and use various controls available to manage individual participants.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Participant-host-panel-window.png" alt-text="Participant panel for host panel":::

At the top of the panel, you have *two tabs* to choose from:

- **Participants:** See participants in your room, which can be sorted by *All*, *Hand raised*, or *Broadcasting*.
- **Rooms:** See a list of all of the rooms in your multiroom event, including the Host Room. For each room, there's a attendee count to see how many people are in each room.

## Control panel

The Control panel is used to control the content or artifacts that were added when customizing an Event or Event template. To learn more, see how to [Customize your event](customize-event.md).

### Control artifacts in the Control panel

1. Select the **Control panel** button in the bottom right of the menu bar.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Event-production-control-panel-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Mesh app showing Control panel button and panel":::

In the Control panel, you'll see all the artifacts and content that you added to your Event or Event Template.

1. In the Control panel, select an artifact and interact with its controls as desired during your event.

    In the example below, in the **Play state** section for the **Video** artifact, we can select the **Play** button to play the video.
