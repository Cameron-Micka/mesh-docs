# Produce your event

## Considerations before starting your event

### Customize **before** your event

To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize and save customizations at least 30 minutes before the event start time.

### Event capacity

An event can support up to 200 people, however only 16 people can be in the same room and interact spatially together. Use the broadcast feature to communicate with all participants.

To support broadcasting and other producer tools, however, we *technically* support a total of **224 people per event**:

- `13` rooms per event
- `208` attendees per event ⇒ `13 rooms` × `16 people`
- `16` hosts per event
- `224` total people in event ⇒ `208 attendees` + `16 hosts`

⚠️ Note also that you can only have **3 event hosts broadcast at the same time.**

## Event Producers tools

- **Host Panel:** See the participants in your event and use the host panel toolbar to access the *Mute all*, *Megaphone*, *Broadcast*, and  *Share* buttons
- **Control Panel:** Control the elements you add to the environment with scripted sequences of events. Imagine a curtain raise to signal the start of the event!
- **Event templates:**  Create a template of your event with all customizations that you add to reuse in future events

## Producing your event

After you've created your event, customized it, and added content to the control panel, it's time to join and produce your event.

> [!TIP]
> **Ensure that you've customized your event properly** (added custom content or artifacts to your environment, added it to the control panel, and saved) before producing your event.

1. Open the Mesh app directly or use the link your calendar invite to open the Mesh app.

1. Find your event in the **Upcoming** or **Happening now** sections, and select **Join**.
