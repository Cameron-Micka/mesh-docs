# Overview of Mesh events

Events in Mesh should be familiar to most organizations that work with Microsoft Teams. The general flow is to:

1. **Create an event in the Mesh Portal:** Start with the Mesh Portal to create or edit your event, invite participants, and manage Mesh worlds.
1. **Customize the event in the Mesh app:** Customize your event beforehand to add text, video, and/or screenshare artifacts and prepare your environment for your event.
1. **Host your event in Mesh:** Leverage a set of tools to manage participants, and control the artifacts that you've added to your environment.

## Create your event in the Mesh Portal

Create an event in the Mesh Portal and invite participants. Once created, participants will see the event in their calendars in Microsoft Teams and Outlook.

## Customize your event

The power of Mesh really becomes clear when you customize your event by adding artifacts to your environment prior to the meeting start time. Add text, video players, or a screenshare screen that can be controlled during your run-of-show to engage and wow attendees.
