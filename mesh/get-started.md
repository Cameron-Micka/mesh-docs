# Get started with Microsoft Mesh (Preview)

[Microsoft Mesh](overview.md) is currently available in limited free preview. During the preview, you can try the Mesh app on your HoloLens, and request access to host virtual events in Mesh-enabled AltspaceVR. We will provide information on the availability of additional Mesh-enabled apps with time as the service generally becomes available.
