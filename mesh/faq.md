# Microsoft Mesh (Preview) FAQ

## What is Microsoft Mesh?

Microsoft Mesh enables people to collaborate with presence, as if physically present in the same room. Through Mesh-enabled experiences, people can gather as 3D avatars or photorealistic representations of themselves in mixed reality. Proximity and spatial audio let people know where they are relative to one another. Users can visualize and annotate content together in a shared 3D space. A user can look at the person they're talking to and point to features on a shared 3D object.

Get started with the Microsoft Mesh preview and stay up to date with news and announcements by following our [Getting Started](get-started.md) instructions and experiencing Mesh on your HoloLens.
