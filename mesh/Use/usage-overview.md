# Mesh user overview

Microsoft Mesh offers a host of powerful features that enhance communication and collaboration in remote and hybrid workplaces. With Microsoft Mesh, you can feel the presence of coworkers in shared experiences on PC or Quest 2, collaborate in 3D environments, and startup side-conversations with ease.

See [Introduction to Mesh](/mesh/overview) for more information.

## Mesh scenarios

Microsoft Mesh is made for corporate events wherein curated experiences
and specific environments can be made to serve business needs -- whether
serving external customers, creating for clients, or hosting internal
employee events.

## Key features

Check out the highlighted features of Mesh below:

- **Join Events from Microsoft Mesh PC app and Quest 2.** Microsoft
    Mesh can be accessed in 2D and 3D, bringing teams together to
    collaborate in environments with intuitive and natural human
    interaction.

- **Customize your avatar.** You can customize your own life-like
    avatars and express yourself with realistic facial features, body
    shapes, hair styling, makeup, and wardrobe.

    [See more details in the section named "Build your personalized avatar](#build-your-personalized-avatar)."

- **Spatial audio**. Users in events
    will hear other participants' voices depending on their distance and spatial orientation. Spatial audio allows multiple localized conversations to happen within the same environment. This provides a natural way to
    virtually socialize which isn't possible without the Mesh-powered online events.
