## Customize your event

If you have a custom environment created Unity, there may be components
you can add to the environment that you can control as an event
producer.

Make your event your own! Create a scripted sequence that you control
for your event -- think props for pizazz or a curtain opening to start
the show.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend customizing an event at least one hour before the
> event is scheduled to ensure a smooth experience.

> [!TIP]
> **Who should customize an event?**
>
> Anyone with **Content contributor** privileges and invited to
> collaborate for an event can also customize an event. Do this with
> caution, knowing that any edits you make will affect the environment
> that event participants will join in.

#### Event Producers tools

- [Control panel](#_Add_Content_with) -- control the elements you add
    to the environment with scripted sequences of events. Imagine a
    curtain raise to signal the start of the event!

- [Event templates](#_Event_templates) -- create a template of your event with all customizations that you add to reuse in future events

#### Open the Manage events page

**Important!** If you don't see **Manage**, then you aren't a [Content
contributor](#content-contributor-permissions) for this world. Please
speak to your IT Admin to get Content contributor privileges.

1. Go to your pinned world, or search for it using the **All Mesh
    worlds** button.

2. You will see the **Manage** button.

**Now that you've joined the event customization experience it's time
to start customizing!**

## Add Content with the Control Panel

Use the **Control Panel** to access the core set of tools that enable
you to set up, customize, and trigger specific show-elements in your
events. Like having a technical booth for theatrical technicians, it's
designed to give the Event Producer the ability to orchestrate a
performance in real time.

1. On the **Manage Events** page, select the **Customize event
    experience** button for the event you wish to customize and
    collaborate on.

    ![A screenshot of a video game Description automatically
    generated](../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image031.png)

**Control Panel Notes**:

- For the playable content to be available, it must have been added to
    the original Unity project used to create the environment. If the
    environment contains no playable content, the **Select content**
    window will be empty. Reference the [Choose your journey](../Create/Getting%20started/choose-your-journey.md)
    to get started with adding custom content.

- For a VideoPlayer, the URL needs to be a publicly accessible
    webpage, or static hosted MP4.

- In the **Select content** window, select the content you want to
    add, and then click the **Add** button.

    The added content appears in the **Control Panel** window:

### Configure the content controls for a Timeline

1. Select the **Play** button for the Timeline.

2. Select or deselect **Scale animation**.

When you're done configuring content for the event, you can exit the
customization session and it will automatically save your changes.

### Producing Live with Configured Content

1. At the start time of your event, join the event.

2. Open the **Control Panel** (it defaults to Live Mode).

3. View your content in the order in which you set it.

4. Play through each item to confirm that the configurations appear as
    you've defined them in your customize event experience.

### Show or Hide Elements

The **Show/Hide** option can eliminate distractions and help the Event
Producer focus on only the elements being used in the show.

**To show or hide an element in the Control Panel:**

1. Ensure that you're in **Edit Mode**.

2. Click the **eyeball icon** to the left of the element name.

**Show:**

**Hide:**

**Note**: Hidden elements aren't deleted from your list, but are hidden
from view while in **Live Mode**.

## Event Production Best Practices

Here are things you need to look out for throughout this process:

1. Don't have multiple producers editing the Control Panel
    simultaneously; the edits may be overwritten.

5. For smooth event production, we recommend that you complete all
    edits at least one hour before showtime. Last minute edits can cause
    problems for your performance.

 **We hope you enjoy the Mesh Producer Experience!**

# Event templates

Now that you've created an event and customized it to your liking,
create an Event template! Event templates to easily reproduce curated
experiences in other events, saving time and effort. Create a template
once and use it again and again!

Simply use a custom or pre-created environment then add Event
integration features (via the Control Panel, Unity Timelines, and Unity
Video Player) to that event. That event can be saved and become a
Template, used across future events with no additional work needed.

## Manage events page
