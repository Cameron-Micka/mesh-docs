# Produce your event

If you have a custom environment created Unity, there may be components
you can add to the environment that you can control as an event
producer.

Make your event your own! Create a scripted sequence that you control
for your event -- think props for pizazz or a curtain opening to start
the show.

### Considerations before starting your event

#### Customize before the event

To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize the event
at least one hour before the event should start.

#### Provision Multiple Rooms before the Event

If you've chosen a Multiple rooms event, ensure that you've provisioned
your Multiple Rooms event at least 30 minutes before the event start
time.

*Provisioning is necessary to enable broadcasting between rooms as the
event host.*

See the [Provision Multiple Rooms event](#provision-multiple-rooms-before-the-event) section for more
info.

## Event Producers tools

- **Control Panel:** Control the elements you add to the environment with scripted sequences of events. Imagine a curtain raise to signal the start of the event!

- **Host Panel:** See the participants in your event and use the host panel toolbar to access the *Mute all*, *Megaphone*, *Broadcast*, and  *Share* buttons.

- **Event templates:**  Create a template of your event with all customizations that you add to reuse in future events

## Producing your event

After you've created your event and customized it, it's time to join and produce your event.

1. Find your event and select **Join now**.

Once you select **Join now**, you'll utilize two main tools for your run of show:

## Event templates

Now that you've created an event and customized it to your liking,
create an Event template! Event templates to easily reproduce curated
experiences in other events, saving time and effort. Create a template
once and use it again and again!

Simply use a custom or pre-created environment then add Event
integration features (via the Control Panel, Unity Timelines, and Unity
Video Player) to that event. That event can be saved and become a
Template, used across future events with no additional work needed.

## Create a template

1. In the left-side vertical button bar, click the icon of your World,
    or click the **All Mesh worlds** button to find your world.\
