# Customize your event

Now that you've created your event, it's time to customize your event to add any run-of-show tools you'd like to use during your event.

## Considerations before starting your event

### Customize before the event

To ensure the event runs smoothly, ensure that you customize the event
at least one hour before the event should start.

#### Provision Multiple Rooms before the Event

If you've chosen a Multiple rooms event, ensure that you've provisioned
your Multiple Rooms event at least 30 minutes before the event start
time.

*Provisioning is necessary to enable broadcasting between rooms as the event host.*

> [!TIP]
> **Who should customize an event?**
>
> Anyone who has been invited as a **Co-organizer** can customize an event. Do this with
> caution, knowing that any edits you make will affect the environment
> that event participants will join in.

## Event Producers tools

The major tools you'll use to produce your event are the:

- [Environment editor](#add-content-with-the-environment-editor) -- add content to your environment like a screenshare, image, or video.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image-environment-editor-video-player.png" alt-text="Video player showing while avatar is customizing it":::

- [Control Panel](#prepare-content-with-the-control-panel) -- control the elements you add
    to the environment with scripted sequences of events. Imagine a
    curtain raise to signal the start of the event!

- [Event templates](#event-templates) -- create a template of your event with all customizations that you add to reuse in future events

## Artifacts

Use the Environment editor to place artifacts in your environment and customize the content displayed in each artifact.

Currently, the three artifacts that you can add to your event are **Video**, **Screenshare**, and **Image**.

## Add content with the Environment editor

Use the environment editor to add content to your environment that can be controlled during your run-of-show.

1. Open the Mesh app on your computer or use the link in the calendar invite.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Join-event-link-calendar.gif" alt-text="Join calendar invite Mesh":::

1. Look for the event in the **Upcoming** category and select it.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Customize-event-entrypoint3.png" alt-text="Event showing in Mesh app in the upcoming category":::

1. In the Event details window, select **Customize**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Customize-event-entrypoint-event-details.png" alt-text="Customize button in the event details window":::

1. Select the **Join now** button.

1. Once it loads, Select the **Environment editor** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/Environment-editor-button-open.png" alt-text=":::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image-environment-editor.png" alt-text="Environment editor button in Mesh.":::":::

1. Select the **+** button to open the Catalog of artifact you can add. Select one to add it to the environment editor.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/environment-editor-open-artifacts - Made with Clipchamp.gif" alt-text="Open environment editor and add artifact":::

1. Once you've added an artifact, you'll see it show up in the Artifacts window as shown below:
    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image-environment-editor-added-artifact.png" alt-text="Video player artifact shown in list of artifacts":::

    Note the **Copy**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons available for the selected artifact.

1. Now you can manipulate the artifact as you'd like by selecting it with your cursor, dragging it to another location, or using the edges of the artifacts to scale them as you see fit.

### Video player artifact requirements

For video artifacts, you must:
- Use **.MP4** file type only.
- Use direct links to video files that are stored on SharePoint or HTTPS URLs. Links to video services like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. are not supported

    For example, use the **Share** or the **Copy Link** functionality in SharePoint to copy the link of the video you want to share and paste it in the Video player artifact URL field.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/SharePoint-link.png" alt-text="Sharepoint link copied in sharepoint":::

### Configure content controls for artifacts

Once you've added an artifact to the Artifact panel, you can select the artifact edit its controls.

1. Select an added artifact to open up the controls window.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/image-environment-editor-open-controls-window.png" alt-text="Controls window showing for artifact that has been added to an environment":::

1. Configure the controls for the artifact. For example, you can add the URL for your video:

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/mesh-event-producer-guide/environment-editor-add-artifacts.gif" alt-text="Add artifacts and update url":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The only video type that is supported is **.MP4** inside the video artifact.

## Prepare content with the Control Panel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **must add the artifacts to the Control Panel** and **save** before starting your event.


Use the **Control Panel** to prepare your artifacts to be used during an event. Like having a technical booth for theatrical technicians, it's designed to give the Event Producer the ability to orchestrate a performance in real time.

1. After you've joined the session, click the "Control panel" button.

**Control Panel Notes:**

- Playable content can be added in the environment editor or in the Unity project then uploaded in a custom environment. Reference the [Choose your journey article](../../Create/getting-started/choose-your-journey.md)
    to get started with adding custom content.

## Save your content

Before you start your event, you must save the changes that you've made to your environment.

Select the Event Customization button, then select **Save changes** or **Revert changes.**

### Preview the live run of your event

Within a Customize event experience, open the Control Panel, then Toggle
to Preview Mode.

While in preview mode, you can test out using the control panel to play your video or interact with your content.

When you're done configuring content for the event, you can exit the
customization session and it will automatically save your changes.
