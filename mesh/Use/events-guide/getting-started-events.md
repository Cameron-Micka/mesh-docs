# Getting started with events

## Event production features

Mesh offers the following features for the Events attendance and
production:

- **[Event Creation](#events):** Users can now create and manage
    events in the Mesh app.

  - [**Single Room or Multiple room
        events**:](#single-vs-multiple-room-events) Host an event in a
        single room with 16 people or create a multi-room event with
        up-to 200 people overall, split into 16 person
        rooms.

  - [**Invite participants**](#to-invite-a-guest) to join your
        meeting in Mesh.

  - [**Invite collaborators**](#_To_invite_collaborators:) to help
        manage or customize the event.

- **[Event Production](#producing-your-event):** Use several host
    tools via the Control Panel to run the event.

  - **Broadcasting**: In the multi-room scenario, the Event Producer
        can broadcast to each room at the same time

  - **Megaphone:** Use the megaphone to make your audible to all
        participants.

  - **Mute All:** Mute the participants to hone focus in on what
        matters.

  - **Custom:** Control your customizations during a meeting to
        create a scripted experience and wow your audience.

- **[Event Customization](#customize-your-event):** Join event
    customization sessions with other Event Producers to create scripted
    experiences with custom component that are added by developers to
    the environment.

  - [**Customize event experience**](#customize-event-experience)
        allowing multiple Event Producers to simultaneously customize an
        immersive event experience.

  - **[Control Panel](#_Add_Content_with)** to create scripted
        events that you can trigger during a meeting.

  - Live Event playthrough of Unity Timelines & Video Players

- **[Event Templates](#_Event_templates):** Producers can use custom
    or pre-created environments for creating events, add event content
    via the Environment Editing Tools and Control Panel, then save it as
    a Template for use in future events. The content elements added or
    removed from the Control Panel will be saved in your Template but
    still require manual execution.

- **Custom environments:** A custom environment with features created
    using the Mesh Toolkit, including Event content integration
    features. See *"Get started with Mesh environments.pdf" for
    developer guidance.

    *Event content integration added to custom environments are exposed
    to event producers (with content contributor privileges) in a Mesh
    event customization session. These can then be controlled and reused
    by event producers in events. All these are configured via the
    Control Panel, saved as a template, and used in any future events.*

## Prerequisites for producing events

### Content contributor Role in Azure

To create, manage, or customize events for a Mesh world, your account
must be added as a Content contributor. Speak to your Azure or IT Admin
to get added as a Content contributor for a Mesh world if you haven't
been already. "*Mesh IT Admin Guide.pdf"*

### Create the event or be invited to collaborate on it

To create, manage, or customize events you must have created the event
yourself or be a collaborator for the event.

## Mesh dashboard overview

The dashboard home is where all Mesh content and experiences live. From
here, you can **discover** events, go to your favorite worlds that
you've **pinned**, or explore **all worlds**.
