# Help with Mesh events

## Discussion

Further detail on various topics to dive deeper or understand topics
better.

## Content contributor permissions

To create, manage, or customize events for a Mesh world, your account
must be added as a Content contributor. Speak to your Azure or IT Admin
to get added as a Content contributor for a Mesh world if you haven't
been already. "*Mesh IT Admin Guide.pdf"*

## Adding guests to events in bulk

There are some known limitations with adding guests in bulk. We are
working on a resolution. For now, keep these things in mind while adding
guests:

- **Tenant only (work emails only, for example).** You are limited in
    who you can invite to a Mesh meeting by who is in the tenant that
    you are in. In other words, you are only able to invite people with
    a similar email to you. Otherwise, Mesh will not be able to find the
    email in the backend and invite them.

 *For example, you can only invite people with an \@EmailForWork.com
 email:*

 Event Producer email: <eventproducer@EmailForWork.com>

 Invitee emails: <invitee@EmailForWork.com>

- **Try to clean up copy/pasted list of emails.** If your emails are
    copy/pasted with unique formatting, Mesh may not be able to
    determine what the emails are. Please only separate emails by commas
    (,) when pasting them.

 *Incorrect:*

 \<\[<Person1@EmailForWork.com>\]\, \<\[<Person2@EmailForWork.com>\]\,
 ... , ...

 *Correct:*

 <Person1@EmailForWork.com>, <Person2@EmailForWork.com>, ... , ...
