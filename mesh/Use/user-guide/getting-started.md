# Getting started with Microsoft Mesh

Users of Mesh for Custom Worlds can access events through the Mesh app
with the following access points:

- [Mesh app for PC](#microsoft-mesh-app-for-pc)

- [Mesh for Oculus Quest 2](#microsoft-mesh-on-quest-2)

Here's how to download and install the Mesh app on PC and the Meta Quest 2 devices.

## Microsoft Mesh app for PC

Download the Microsoft Mesh app on PC (codenamed **Project Napili**)
from the Microsoft Store for Business to access Events and to customize
your Avatar. Visit the link below:

>[!Note]
>If the app isn't available in the Microsoft Store, speak to
your Intune admin to make the app visible to you.

## Microsoft Mesh on Quest 2

>[!Important]
>There may be problems with accessing your corporate data through the
Mesh app on Quest 2. To gain access to Meta enterprise support, check
your corporate security policies or contact your IT admin.

### Mesh on Quest 2 available through App Lab

If you had previously downloaded the **Napili** app on your Quest 2
device, you should move to the new app available at the link below.
**Napili** will be deprecated in lieu of the new Microsoft **Mesh
(Preview) app**.

1. On your PC, visit the link below to download Mesh on Quest 2.

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Microsoft Mesh (Preview) on Oculus Quest 2 \| Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8919580184782498/)

    If the URL doesn't work, use a new private window in your browser.

2. Sign in with your **Meta device account** (*not* your corporate AAD
    account). This could be your Meta ID, Facebook account, or another
    email.
