# Mesh user controls

## Mesh Dashboard

The Mesh Dashboard displays all Mesh events available to you. The Mesh Dashboard is the main interface you can use to explore what Mesh has to offer.

The Dashboard is viewable using the Mesh App on PC or Quest.

### Dashboard vertical navigation bar

On the left-side vertical navigation bar, there are mainly three types of items. From here you can open the **Home** view, see your Teams events, or browse and join event(s) and events in Mesh worlds that have
been set up by your IT admin.

The **Home** button at the top left shows you the events happening now and upcoming events for all worlds you have access to.

Select a pinned world in the left-side vertical navigation to see events for that specific world. All pinned worlds will be visible in this left navigation beneath the **Home** button.

>On the Dashboard, the changes from upcoming to live events are updated automatically in the **Events** view.

### All Mesh Worlds

The **All Mesh Worlds** button can be found in the lower left corner of the Dashboard. Use this button to explore Mesh worlds that are available to you. Also, you can choose to **Pin** or **Unpin** a Mesh World to the left vertical navigation bar of the Dashboard.

## Move around in your event

### On PC

You can look around, walk, run, teleport around, or just sit at the
table with other avatars. To move around, press the **WASD** keys.

- Press and hold on **W, S, A,** or **D** to leave your chair when
    sitting

    person views)

Here are some keyboard shortcuts for moving around in your event:

### On your Quest headset

You can look around, walk, run, turn, teleport around, or just sit at the table with other avatars all with the Quest controllers!

## Mesh controls overview

Now that you're in an event, explore the interface to see what controls are available. To the left, we have the **System Menu** with **Dashboard**, **Settings**, **Feedback**, and **Quit Mesh**. The app bar in the middle holds the **Participants**, **Selfie**, and **Reactions** buttons. The **Profile** button in the lower right corner
holds the **Customize** button for customizing your avatars.

Selecting on the photo icon in the menu will take you to the SharePoint folder where your photos are stored.

### React with emotes

In the app bar, you can trigger **Reactions**, that cause your avatar to
react with body gestures as well as emotes.
