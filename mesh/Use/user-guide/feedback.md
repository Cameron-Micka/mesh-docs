# Feedback for Mesh

We would love for you to provide us with feedback and bug reports!

For documentation feedback, click this link: [*Mesh TAP Documentation Feedback*](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRzFnuK83QapOmAXDLf57ZE9UMzdVSlNDU0NRSFozSlNXWDBNSUhDNDYzQy4u).

For product feedback, use the **Feedback** button inside your Mesh experience. This ensures that your feedback and bug reporting will be triaged and incorporated quickly.

If you're not able to give feedback or report bugs using the **Feedback** button in the Mesh App, you can chat with your Microsoft partners in Teams, or contact your Microsoft partners directly.
