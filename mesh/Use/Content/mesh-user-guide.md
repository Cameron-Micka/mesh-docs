## Introduction to Microsoft Mesh

Microsoft Mesh offers a host of powerful features that enhance
communication and collaboration in remote and hybrid workplaces. With
Microsoft Mesh, you can feel the presence of coworkers in shared
experiences on PC or Quest 2, collaborate in 3D environments, and
startup side-conversations with ease.

See *Introduction to Mesh.pdf* for more information.

## Mesh scenarios

Microsoft Mesh is made for corporate events wherein curated experiences
and specific environments can be made to serve business needs -- whether
serving external customers, creating for clients, or hosting internal
employee events.

![A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated](../../media/end-user-guide/image003.jpg)

## Key features

Check out the highlighted features of Mesh below:

- **Join Events from Microsoft Mesh PC app and Quest 2.** Microsoft
    Mesh can be accessed in 2D and 3D, bringing teams together to
    collaborate in environments with intuitive and natural human
    interaction.

- **Customize your avatar.** You can customize your own life-like
    avatars and express yourself with realistic facial features, body
    shapes, hair styling, makeup, and wardrobe.

    [See more details in the section named "Build your personalized
    avatar](#build-your-personalized-avatar)."

    ![](../../media/end-user-guide/image004.jpg)

- **Spatial audio**. Users in events
    will hear other participants' voices depending on their distance and
    spatial orientation.

    Spatial audio allows multiple localized conversations to happen
    within the same environment. This provides a natural way to
    virtually socialize which isn't possible without the Mesh-powered
    online events.

## Build your personalized avatar

### Introduction to Avatars for Teams

Avatars for Microsoft Teams enables you to build connections in events
without turning your video on. Include more people in the
conversation--- whether they need a break due to video fatigue or just
feel more comfortable with their video off. Add a new layer of choice to
your events.

![](../../media/end-user-guide/image015.png)

- **Choose how you're represented** --
    Select from hundreds of combinations to customize an avatar that
    represents your physical attributes, wardrobe, accessories, and
    more. Choose how you express yourself with reactions. Save up to
    three avatars for different event types, such as casual,
    professional, or day-to-day.

- **Build connections your way** -- In addition to joining an event
    with your camera on and off, you can also join with an avatar.
    Combat video fatigue and include more people in the conversation,
    even those who are less comfortable with their video on. Avatars for
    Microsoft Teams gives you that much-needed camera break while still
    allowing you to collaborate effectively.

- **Stay in Teams -** Available within the Microsoft Teams experience.
    Once your avatar is created, it's just a few clicks away.

## How to start customizing avatars

You can access avatar customization from the following entry points:

- Mesh app on PC

- Mesh app on Quest

You can create up to three different versions of your avatar to show off
your personas in Mesh experiences.

To create a new avatar, select **+** in the bottom right corner of your
Mesh App. 

![](../../media/end-user-guide/image028.png)


You'll be asked to select a base avatar to start creating.

![A screenshot of a video game Description automatically

Select your desired avatar and click **Use Avatar**, and you're ready to
start customizing your avatar.

## Customizing your avatars

Once you're inside of an event, hover over your **profile bubble** and
select **Customize** to start customizing your avatar.

![A screenshot of a video game Description automatically

There's a horizontal toolbar with five options: **Body, Face, Hair,
Appearance,** and **Wardrobe.**

![A screenshot of a video game Description automatically
generated](../../media/end-user-guide/image019.png)

The initial screen shows you the **Body** section. Note there are three
buttons in the far left-side column: **Body Shape**, **Prosthetic**, and
**Skin tone**. For **Body Shape, Face Shape,** and other subsections, we
offer presets for quick customization. Users can fine-tune a preset by
clicking the **sliders** button.

### Avatar body shape

To the left of the avatar, there's a palette with various shape options.
Select any shape option to see how your avatar would look.  

**Note:** Selecting the **slider** button will customize your current
body shape. You can begin by selecting a body shape preset and click the
**slider** button to fine tune it.

        dialog box.

adjust it with the slider at the bottom.

We've added many facial features for fine-tuning with **sliders**, such
as **Cranium** width/height, **Cheek Bone** width and fullness, **Cheek
Fullness**, and so much more. These customizable options offer even more
precision when crafting your avatar. Be sure to click through each page
to see all the options for **Face Shape** customization!

other sections in the left vertical menu, including **Nose**, **Mouth**,
and **Ears**. Choose a feature, select the one you want from the
palette, use the **sliders** to fine-tune, and then **Save** or
**Discard**.

#### Change Hair

**Hair Style**, **Facial Hair**, and **Eyebrow(s)**. With **Hair
Style**, you can filter for short or long hair styles by clicking on the
filter button as shown below:
